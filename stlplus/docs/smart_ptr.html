<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A smart pointer is a class that acts like a pointer but which also deletes
the object pointed to when finished. It is, if you like, a memory-managing
pointer.</p>

<p>A smart pointer maintains a pointer to a single object. It also keeps a
count of how many smart pointers point to the object. When smart pointers are
assigned or 'copied', no copying of the object pointed to takes place,
instead the pointer count is just incremented. This is known as
<i>aliasing</i>. When a destructor is called, the count is just decremented.
This is known as <i>dealising</i>. The object itself is destroyed when the
count is decremented to zero, indicating that the last alias has been
destroyed.</p>

<p>There's lots of reasons for using smart pointers in C++ and I now find it
hard to remember how I managed without. Or why I didn't write this component
many years earlier than I did. Lots of hours, days, weeks even months have
been blown away uselessly in debugging of memory problems, running memory
diagnostic tools (even writing one) and generally squandering effort on
problems which were, in hindsight, a product of a bad programming style.</p>

<p>C++ novices don't at first understand what possible use smart pointers are
- don't you just delete a pointer when you've finished with it? This is a
naive viewpoint as I hope will become clear in the explanation that
follows.</p>

<p>Here's my top 5 reasons for using smart pointers:</p>

<h3>Reason 1 - C++ Polymorphism Must be Implemented as Pointers to Objects</h3>

<p>In C++, you manipulate families of derived classes through a pointer
to the base class. You can then access virtual functions by dereferencing the
baseclass pointer. For example</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class base
{
  ...
  virtual void print(void) const;
};

class derived : public base
{
  ...
  virtual void print(void) const;
};

...

base* b = new derived;
b-&gt;print(); // actually calls derived::print
</pre>

<p>The reason that you must use pointers here is that classes base and derived
could be of different sizes - so you cannot assign a derived to a variable of
type base. This rule is enforced by C++.</p>

<p>However, the use of pointers introduces a potential problem - the pointer
is unmanaged. That is, the memory it points to will not be recovered when it
goes out of scope. Okay, so you can simply delete it, but that doesn't solve
the problem of what to do if an exception is thrown. You could have a catch
blcok in every single function you write that allocates memory - but then
you've written a lot of code that in practice cannot be tested. It is good C++
practice to make all variables self-destroying so that they destroy themselves
if an exception is thrown. Then you don't need catch blocks. Not only does
making all variables self-destroying make for cleaner programming, but it is
the only realistic way of making your code exception-safe.</p>

<p>The solution to all this is to use smart pointers (the cloning variant in
the case of polymorphic types) rather than simple pointers. Then the memory is
managed by the smart pointer - if the pointer goes out of scope either because
rthe function returns or because an exception is thrown, then all its contents
will be destroyed correctly.</p>

<h3>Reason 2 - Using Pointers to Objects in STL Container Classes</h3>

<p>Now look at an even more typical problem. In this case you want to store
pointers to objects in an STL container for whatever reason. The problem is
that this means that the vector no longer acts as a true container, because if
the vector is cleared or goes out of scope or elements are removed, the
pointers <b>will not</b> be deleted. You have just written a leaky program.
Trying to keep track of these pointers and delete them yourself every time you
change the vector is terribly clumsy and error prone and is definitely not
pukka C++. You see, the vector is supposed to be a <i>container</i> class - it
should manage the memory of the objects it contains. However, using simple
pointers breaks the container nature of the component.</p>

<p>The solution is to use smart pointers rather than simple pointers. Then the
memory is managed by the smart pointer - if the STL container goes out of
scope then all its contents will be destroyed correctly.</p>

<h3>Reason 3 - Minimising Reallocation Overhead</h3>

<p>The vector is one of the most useful template classes in the STL. It has
one potential problem which totally freaks out some programmers, but not for a
good reason. The problem is that, when a vector has to resize, it does so by
copying all of its contents into a new vector. It does so by using the copy
constructor of the contained type. Therefore a vector of 1000 objects results
in 1000 calls to the copy constructor. This is not itself a problem if the
constructor is trivial since the call overhead is negligible.</p>

<p>However, if the type stored in the vector is big and/or complicated, then
the copy overhead can become serious. Storing a pointer to the object in the
vector is not a good idea - see Reason 2 above. The solution is to use a
vector of smart pointers to objects. Then, when the vector resizes, it copies
the smart pointer, not the object. The overhead of copying a smart pointer is
negligible - only slightly more than a simple pointer.</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>

<h3>Reason 4 - Preserving the Object's Memory Address</h3>

<p>Another similar problem is that, if you keep an object in an STL vector
and the vector reallocates for any reason, then the object changes its
position in memory and any pointer to the old object no longer points to
it.</p>

<p>Adding a level of indirection using a smart-pointer solves this
problem, because now we have the behaviour of a pointer in that it
is the smart pointer class that gets moved in memory, not the object
that it contains, but we also have the memory-management of an
object so there is no requirement for the user to manage the memory
of the object.</p>

<h3>Reason 5 - Returns Must be Implemented as Pass-by-Value</h3>

<p>It is often useful to write functions that create data structures and
return them. However, there are problems with this.</p>

<p>Passing back a reference is illegal if the function created
the object as an automatic (local) variable, since that is destroyed in the
return so that the reference returned now refers to destroyed memory. This is
a well-known pitfall in C++.</p>

<p>Creating the object with new and passing back a pointer to the object seems
to be a good solution and indeed it is a sort-of solution. However, it is a
bodged solution, not a real one. The problem with this is that the returned
value is not memory managed and will leak in the case of an exception being
thrown. It can also make code difficult to read and debug because the place
where the data structure is allocated is a very different place to where it is
destroyed. This is a well-known source of memory bugs - inevitably the
question of which part of the program is responsible for the deallocation
becomes confused and you can end up with either leaky code or double-deletion
and the memory corruption that results.</p>

<p>If you return by value, this causes a copy constructor to be called. This
is fine for small data structures where the copy overhead is correspondingly
small, but it is undesirable if the data staructure is big and impossible if
the data structure cannot be copied (occasionally it is necessary to design
data structures that are not copiable).</p>

<p>The solution is to create the object in a smart pointer and return it by
value. Pass by value with a smart pointer just creates an alias and so has
negligible overhead. However, the smart pointer is managing the object's
memory, so the program does not need to remember to delete it later. It will
delete itself when it is no longer in use.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I think the days of tracking dynamic memory lifetimes through layers of
software and running leakage diagnostics in programs is now well past. It
belongs in the 80s along with the Commodore Pet and the Sinclair QL. Debugging
double-deletion problems is an absolute nightmare and totally unnecessary when
it is possible and practical to make every data structure self-managing.</p>

<p>The gist of my argument is that we live in more sophisticated and
enlightened times. It is no longer necessary to do any memory allocation or
deallocation yourself - all memory can and should be allocated implicitly by
container classes.</p>

<p>If I dare to say so, you end up programming in C++ in a similar style to
Java. The advantage is that no garbage collection is needed because objects
are deleted properly when they go out of scope rather than drifting off in the
vain hope that the garbage collector might eventually spot it. Ten bonus
points to C++ I think.</p>

<p>The STL doesn't deal with this issue (well, it does have a memory managing
pointer class called auto_ptr which is a partial solution, but its pretty
crap. Come to think of it, totally crap would be a better verdict). Thus the
smart pointer classes are my solution to the issue. For the last two
years the only time I've written calls to delete are when designing the
container classes in STLplus and the only calls to new are in the same classes
or when when supplying the clone() functions required
when using polymorphic types with smart_ptr_clone (more later). There is not
one single call to delete anywhere in over a megabyte of application code that
I've written in that time. There is not a single memory leak and it has been
well over two years at the time of writing since I had any memory leaks in any
software I have written. It is truly a thing of the past.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="kinds">Smart Pointer Kinds</h2>

<p>There are in fact three different classes defined in the smart_ptr.hpp
header. They vary in their ability to create copies of the object pointed to:</p>

<dl>

<dt>template&lt;typename T&gt; class smart_ptr</dt>

<dd>This is a smart pointer intended for use on simple types and single
classes. It uses the copy constructor to copy the object of type T that it
contains.</dd>

<dt>template&lt;typename T&gt; class smart_ptr_clone</dt>

<dd>This is a smart pointer intended for use on polymorphic types - that is
families of classes and subclasses which are manipulated through a pointer to
their superclass. It uses a clone() function to copy objects.</dd>

<dt>template&lt;typename T&gt; class smart_ptr_nocopy</dt>

<dd>This is a smart pointer intended for use on objects that cannot be copied
- for example a class that contains a system resource other than memory where
copying makes no sense, or a data structure too complex to implement a copy
operation in a reasonable time-frame. It is like smart_ptr but has all
operations that cause copying of the pointed-to object stripped out.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Although there are three variants of the smart pointer class, they have
almost identical interfaces, so they are described together here. I use the
most common variant - smart_ptr - as the basis of this description and then
describe the differences with the variants at the end.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="structors">Constructing and Destroying</h2>

<p>There are four constructors and of course a destructor for smart_ptr:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr::smart_ptr(void);
explicit smart_ptr::smart_ptr(T* data);
smart_ptr::smart_ptr(const T&amp; data);
smart_ptr::smart_ptr(const smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; r);
smart_ptr::~smart_ptr(void);
</pre>

<p>The first of the constructors simply creates a null pointer (it is perfectly legal and
correct to have a null smart_ptr).</p>

<p>The second constructs a smart pointer from a pointer to an object. This pointer must be
created using <code>new</code> (if you pass the address of an automatic variable, things
will go horribly wrong). For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s1 = new string("Hello World");
</pre>

<p>The third constructs a pointer from an object. Note however that the
smart_ptr copies the object passed in this way. It does not manage the
original object. This is because the smart_ptr must contain an object created
dynamically (on the heap) using new, and ensures this by doing the allocation
itself.</p>

<p>The final form of constructor is the copy constructor - bit it doesn't copy
the contents of the pointer. Instead it implements the aliasing behaviour of
the smart pointer classes.</p>

<p>The destructor implements the other half of the aliasing
behaviour. When a smart pointer is destroyed, the alias count is
decremented. If this makes it zero, then the object contained by the smart
pointer is deleted.</p>

<p>A simple example illustrates how a pointer is constructed and initialised in
a single step:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s1(string("testing"));
</pre>

<p>In fact, because the string class has an implicit type conversion from
char*, it can be written more simply than this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s2("testing");
</pre>

<p>Here's another example which constructs two smart pointers to point to
the same string:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
string s = "testing";
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s1 = s;
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s2 = s1;
</pre>

<p>This example takes advantage of the C++ convention that an initialisation
expressed as an assignment is in fact a call to the constructor. The first
line creates a string initialised with the value "testing". The second line
creates a smart pointer initialised with a <i>copy</i> of this (remember that
the object contained by the smart pointer is copied into it). The third line
creates another smart pointer which is an <i>alias</i> of the first one. Note
that the second smart pointer is initialised from the first smart pointer,
meaning they point to the same object.</p>

<p>Since both s1 and s2 point to the same string, modifying the string though s1
will result in the string pointed to by s2 apparently changing. However, the
string in s1 and s2 is a <i>copy</i> of the original string s, so changing s will not
change s1 or s2.</p>

<p>Typically the object is constructed as an anonymous temporary in the call
to the smart_ptr constructor:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt; s1(string("testing"));
</pre>

<p>Note that an anonymous temporary object can be constructed by using the class
name (in this case 'string') as if it was a function call. This is a common
convention in 21<sup>st</sup> century C++.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<p>As is the usual convention with C++ classes, there is an assignment
operator corresponding to each constructor with equivalent behaviour (except
of course for the void constructor since C++ doesn't allow the use of void as
a value).</p>

<p>First, there is an assignment that allows the object pointed to by
smart_ptr to be replaced by a new-allocated object:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; smart_ptr::operator=(T* data);
</pre>

<p>So for example, you can write:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1 = new string("Hello World");
</pre>

<p>Once again you <i>must</i> allocate this with new. If you pass a pointer to
an automatic variable, the smart pointer will later try to delete it.
Similarly, don't pass the address of an object already contained in another
data type - both containers will try to delete it.</p>

<p>The purpose of this function is to allow an object to be alloced and then
handed over to the smart pointer to be managed by it without incurring the
overhead of a copy operation. Assigning an object (rather than a pointer to
the object) to a smart pointer causes a copy of the object to be made (see
just below). This is fine for simple types and data structures since the copy
overhead is small. For large data structures however, the copy overhead can
become excessive. Furthermore some objects cannot be copied. In this case it
is more efficient to use pointer assignment for this. However, it is
potentially dangerous in that if an invalid address is passed in (for example
the address of an automatic variable) then all hell will break loose.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: It is <i>your</i> fault if you get caught out by this. I have
warned you to be careful!</p>

<p><b>Note</b> 2: I seriously considered removing the T* constructor and
assignment because of the possibility of it being abused. However,
initialising a smart pointer this way avoids copying the object - and in some
cases this is essential either because the object is very big or is designed
to be uncopyable (i.e. has no copy constructor or assignment operator
available). So just be careful.</p>

<p>When you assign to a smart pointer in this way, not only that smart pointer
but all aliases of it end up pointing to the new object.</p>

<p>Furthermore, assigning a null pointer will clear the smart pointer and all
of its aliases.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; smart_ptr::operator=(const T&amp; data);
</pre>

<p>This assignment of the contained type T to the smart pointer changes the
value pointed to by this smart pointer and of all other pointers that are
aliases to it. It deletes the old value and then creates a new object which
is a copy of the parameter.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1 = "Hello World";
</pre>

<p>This is slightly strange behaviour - you are assigning a string to a
smart_ptr&lt;string&gt;! With simple pointers this would be illegal, but smart
pointers allow it. The old value of the string will be discarded and the new
value copied into its place. It is approximately equivalent to dereferencing the pointer and
assigning to the string itself:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
*s1 = "Hello World";
</pre>

<p>There's a final form of assignment:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; smart_ptr::operator=(const smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
</pre>

<p>This assignment of a smart pointer to another dealiases this smart
pointer from any other aliases and deletes the contents if this was the
last alias to it. It then makes this smart pointer a alias to the
parameter.</a>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="set">Setting a simple pointer</h2>

<pre class="cpp">
void smart_ptr::set(T* data = 0);
</pre>

<p>This deletes the previous pointer and adopts the passed pointer instead.
Note: the object passed <i>must</i> be allocated <i>by the user</i> with
<b>new</b>. The default value means that calling set with no argument makes
the pointer null.</p>

<p>In fact this function is functionally identical to the assignment operator:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; smart_ptr::operator=(T* data);
</pre>

<p>It is present in the class because some people prefer its more explicit form.</p>

<p>When you assign to a smart pointer in this way, not only that smart pointer
but all aliases of it end up pointing to the new object.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="tests">Logical Tests</h2>

<p>As the previous section showed, it is possible for a pointer to be null. Of
course, it is therefore necessary to be able to test for a null pointer. No
problem. The smart pointer has a set of four test functions, tests for null
and non-null in two forms; explicit (function) form and implicit (operator)
form. The implicit (operator) form is provided by the following operators:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr::operator bool(void) const;
bool smart_ptr::operator!(void) const;
</pre>

<p>The following examples show how to use these:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (s1)
  &lt;non-null handler&gt;
else if (!s2)
  &lt;null handler&gt;
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, use the explicit (function) form:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool smart_ptr::present(void) const;
bool smart_ptr::null(void) const;
</pre>

<p>In use:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (s1.present())
  &lt;non-null handler&gt;
else if (s2.null())
  &lt;null handler&gt;
</pre>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="dereference">Dereferencing Operators</h2>

<p>The smart pointer classes look <i>quite</i> like pointers in use.</p>

<p>To dereference a smart pointer, simply use the * operator just like a
simple pointer. In fact there are two variants of this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
T&amp; smart_ptr::operator*(void) throw(null_dereference);
const T&amp; smart_ptr::operator*(void) const throw(null_dereference);
</pre>

<p>In other words, if you dereference a non-const smart_ptr you get a non-const reference to the
object which you can then read from or write to. If you dereference a const
smart_ptr, you get back a const reference which is therefore read-only.</p>

<p>Dereferencing a null smart pointer causes the null_dereference
exception to be thrown. Therefore if you are unsure whether a smart pointer is
null, use one of the tests above to check first.</p>

<p>Similarly, just as with simple pointers, to dereference and access a member
in one go, use the -&gt; operator. There are two forms of this too:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
T* smart_ptr::operator-&gt;(void) throw(null_dereference);
const T* smart_ptr::operator-&gt;(void) const throw(null_dereference);
</pre>

<p>So, if you dereference a non-const smart_ptr you get a pointer to a non-const
object and therefore can call non-const methods. If you dereference a const
smart_ptr you get back a pointer to a const object and therefore can only call
const methods.</p>

<p>These operators are strange because they appear to just return a simple pointer -
in fact the language forces you to use them as a prefix to a method call or
member access. Because of this it is illegal to use them to access a null
pointer and the same exception is thrown as with operator*.</p>

<p>There are functions with the same behaviour as these operators, to provide a more
explicit access to the pointer or value pointed to:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void smart_ptr::set_value(const T&amp; data);
T&amp; smart_ptr::value(void) throw(null_dereference);
const T&amp; smart_ptr::value(void) const throw(null_dereference);
</pre>

<p>The set_value method allows the contents of a smart pointer to be changed:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1.set_value("Hello World");
</pre>

<p>There is also an explicit form of the -&gt; operator:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
T* smart_ptr::pointer(void);
const T* smart_ptr::pointer(void) const;
</pre>

<p><b>Hint:</b> The pointer() function does not throw an exception, so it is
unlike the operator-&gt; form in that way, If the smart pointer is null, then
it returns a null simple pointer.</p>

<p>To show how these operators are used, consider the previous smart pointer
to a sring examples:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
*s1 += " 1, 2, 3";
s2-&gt;insert(s2-&gt;begin(), "testing, ");
</pre>

<p>Note that the +=, insert and begin functions all come from the string class.</p>

<p>This leaves both s1 and s2 pointing to a string containing the text "testing,
testing 1, 2, 3".</p>

<p>Rewriting to use the functions rather than the operators:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1.value() += " 1, 2, 3";
s2.pointer()-&gt;insert(s2.pointer()-&gt;begin(), "testing, ");
</pre>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="copying">Forcing a Copy</h2>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to detach two smart pointers to the same object
by creating a new copy of the object and making one pointer point to the new
object. This is achieved with the make_unique() member function. What this
does is force the pointer being made unique to point to a unique copy of the
object. If the pointer is already unique, it has no effect, but otherwise it
creates a local copy unique to itself. For example, to make s1 and s2 in the
earlier examples point to separate strings, do this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s2.make_unique();
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to test whether two pointers point to the same object by
using the aliases() function, which returns a bool and is usually used in a
conditional:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (s1.aliases(s2))
  s2.make_unique();
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to assign a unique copy by using the copy() method:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1 = s2.copy();
</pre>

<p>The copy function returns a new smart pointer which contains a unique copy
of the contents of the object - in this case s2. This smart pointer is then
copied to s1 using the assignment operator - which makes the assignment
efficiently by using alias counting methods. The end result is that s1 and s2
now point to different strings containing the same text.</p>

<p>There is an alternative form of the copy function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s1.copy(s2);
</pre>

<p>This is functionally equivalent but saves an assignment - which is
negligible anyway. However, some people prefer this style.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="clear">Clearing</h2>

<p>There are two functions which clear the contents of a smart pointer, making
it a null pointer:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void clear(void);
void clear_unique(void);
</pre>

<p>To make a smart pointer null - i.e. to force the object pointed to to be
deleted right now, simply call the clear method:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s2.clear();
</pre>

<p><b>Warning:</b> this deletes the object and makes the pointer null. It does
not make the pointer unique first! Thus any other pointers pointing to the
same object will become null too. You could call make_unique first, but that
causes a copy to be made, only for the copy to be instantly deleted again when
you call clear. The solution is to call clear_unique. This clears just this
smart pointer by making it unique and null at the same time.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
s2.clear_unique();
</pre>

<p>This makes s2 null and unique, leaving s1 still pointing to its original value.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions Thrown</h2>

<p>The smart pointer classes can only throw one exception:</p>

<dl>

<dt>null_dereference</dt>

<dd>Thrown if a smart pointer is dereferenced when it is null. This
is a general STLplus exception and is not specific to the smart pointer
classes</dd>

<h2 id="cloning">Clone Variant</h2>

<p>The discussion so far has concentrated
on the variant called smart_ptr. This is designed to be used on simple types and
classes where a copy can be made by simply calling the copy constructor for
the contained object. However, when using hierarchies of derived classes (also
known as polymorphic classes), this is not possible because copy constructors
are not virtual, so you cannot make a copy this way. This is a well-known
problem with C++'s implementation of polymorphism.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is the cloning variant - a class called
smart_ptr_clone. This variant of the smart pointer is designed for use with
polymorphic types. It uses a solution to the non-virtual copy constructor
problem which is suggested by Ellis and Stroustrup in
"The Annoted LRM". The solution is to require the user of the smart pointer to
provide a virtual <code>clone</code> method which makes a copy using <code>new</code> and the
correct copy constructor, returning the result as a pointer to the base class.
Each derivative overloads this function with its own variant which copies its
own type. Thus the copy operation
is now virtual and furthermore is localised to the individual derivative.</p>

<p>In order to use the smart_ptr_clone class, you must first derive the base
class of your polymorphic set of classes from the <code>clonable</code>
<a href="interfaces.html">interface</a>. Then, you must have a virtual clone method overloaded for all
derivatives of that class.</p>

<p>The <code>clonable</code> interface is defined by the following class:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class clonable
{
public:
  virtual clonable* clone(void) const = 0;
};
</pre>

<p>As an example, consider the simple example of two classes, a base class and
a derived class:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class base
{
  ...
};

class derived : public base
{
  ...
};
</pre>

<p>To make these classes suitable for use in a smart pointer, they must be
made <code>clonable</code>. This is done by making the base class a derivative
of the <code>clonable</code> interface and then adding the <code>clone</code>
method to both classes:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class base <b>: public clonable</b>
{
  ...
<b>  clonable* clone(void) const {return new base(*this);}</b>
};

class derived : public base
{
  ...
<b>  clonable* clone(void) const {return new derived(*this);}</b>
};
</pre>

<p>You then create a smart pointer for this by using the base class as the
template parameter:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef smart_ptr_clone&lt;base&gt; base_ptr;
</pre>

<p>The smart_ptr_clone class is identical to the smart_ptr class in its
interface. The only difference is in its implementation. In every case where
smart_ptr would copy the contained object, smart_ptr_clone clones the object
instead.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="nocopy">Nocopy Variant</h2>

<p>This variant of the smart pointer is designed for use on objects that
cannot (or must not) be copied. An example would be when managing an object
that contains, say, a file handle. It is essential that this not be copied
because then you get the problem of deciding which copy is responsible for
closing the file. To avoid the problem, wrap the file handle in a class and
then manage a unique instance of it using a <code>smart_ptr_nocopy</code>.
Indeed, this is exactly what I have done in the TextIO subsystem - a TextIO
device contains a unique instance of a file buffer managed by a
<code>smart_ptr_nocopy</code> object. This ensures that the file buffer cannot
be copied and is closed when the last alias is destroyed.</p>

<p>The interface to the nocopy variant is a stripped-down version of
<code>smart_ptr</code> with all operations that perform copying removed.</p>

<p>The following operations from <code>smart_ptr</code> have been removed
because they use copying of the pointed-to object:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
smart_ptr::smart_ptr(const T&amp; data);
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; smart_ptr::operator=(const T&amp; data);
void smart_ptr::set_value(const T&amp; data);
void smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;::make_unique(void)
void smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;::copy(const smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; data)
smart_ptr&lt;T&gt; smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;::copy(void) const
</pre>

<p>There are also no persistence functions provided for this class - it seems
to me that if an object cannot be copied, it probably cannot be made
persistent either.</p>
