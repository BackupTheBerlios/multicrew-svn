<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is an attempt to document all the changes made to the STLplus
library. The change log was instituted after version 1.1 was frozen and made
an official version. Therefore only the changes since then have been
documented.</p>

<p>The official open-source version of STLplus starts at version 2.0. Earlier
versions were internal (Southampton University) versions. I have
kept the changes for the pre-open-source versions for those users who are
familiar with the older versions and want to know this historical information.</p>

<p>Only the numbered versions from 2.0 upwards are available as downloads. The latest version is
only available through CVS. Pre-version 2.0 are not available from SourceForge.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v2.1">Changes from Version 2.1 to 2.2</h2>

<h3>Changed license terms</h3>

<p>I have changed the license from the Lesser Gnu Public License to the more relaxed and more open
<a href="license.html">BSD License</a>. This makes the STLplus library usable by a wider audience
and with fewer restrictions on how its used. I still hold the copyright and disclaim responsibility
for any errors, as is normal for all software now.</p>

<h3>Fixed CLI Parser Throw Clauses</h3>

<p>The CLI Parser interface had throw clauses that claimed that constructors could only throw the
cli_mode_error exception. In fact they can throw others and these have now been added. For
example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
cli_parser::cli_parser(char* argv[], cli_parser::definitions_t definitions, error_handler&amp; errors)
  throw(cli_mode_error,error_handler_id_error,error_handler_format_error);
</pre>

<h3>Reworked Persistence of Cross-References</h3>

<p>In a number of components (specifically: digraph, ntree) it is possible to make iterators persistent
provided the object (for example the digraph) has been dumped before any iterators are dumped. I
have generalised the code for this and moved the generalised code into persistent.cpp. The
functionality is the same.</p>

<h3>Added folder_all Function to file_system</h3>

<p>The folder_all function returns a vector of all the files and directories in a specified
directory. This is returned as an STL vector of STL strings.</p>

<h3>Allowed Drive Letters in Cygwin Paths in file_system</h3>

<p>As a rule, the Cygwin (a Unix emulation running under MS Windows) build of file_system uses Unix
conventions for paths. However, the underlying Cygwin system can handle Windows drive letters, so I
have added this capability to the file_system functions.</p>

<h3>Made the Hash Class More Compatible With Map</h3>

<p>The old hash::insert method returned the iterator to the inserted object. However, this is
incompatible with map::insert which returns a bool/iterator pair. The interface to hash was always
intended to be compatible with the STL map, so it now returns the same pair:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt; hash::insert(const value_type&amp; value);
</pre>

<p>The map class has a map::count method which returns a count of the number of objects associated
with a key. It returns 0 for not present and 1 for present - this is really useful in multimap.
However, for compatibility I've added it to the hash class:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
size_type hash::count(const K&amp; key) const;
</pre>

<p>It is possible to remove all data from a map with the map::clear method. I've added an equivalent
hash::clear:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void hash::clear(void);
</pre>

<h3>Renamed Time Manupulation Functions in time.hpp</h3>

<p>The old names all had the prefix "time_". This was a poor choice anyway and had the additional
problem of causing name conflicts on some operating systems. In all cases I have renamed the
functions with the prefix "localtime_". This is more consistent with the intent of the functions and
the definition of the concept of localtime in Unix.</p>

<h3>Fixed Bug in persistent.tpp</h3>

<p>I had created the dump/restore_multimap/set functions by cutting and pasting from the
dump/restore_map/set functions. I had forgotten to edit them to change the scope names of the
iterators. This led to compilation errors. I have now fixed these bugs. Thanks to Elias Yanna for
pointing this out.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v2.0">Changes from Version 2.0 to 2.1</h2>

<h3>Added reporting of INI files to cli_parser</h3>

<p>The <code>cli_parser</code> now stores the set of INI file names used in its initialisation. This list is
produced as part of the usage method's output, so that users can see which files they are using.</p>

<p>The <code>cli_parser</code> usage method now looks like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
usage:
	plibrary { arguments }
arguments:
	-[no]help               # this help!
	-create &lt;name&gt;=&lt;path&gt;   # create a library called &lt;name&gt; in directory &lt;path&gt; and add to the list
	-add &lt;path&gt;             # add the library at &lt;path&gt; to the library list
	-remove &lt;name&gt;          # remove the library &lt;name&gt; from the library list
	-delete &lt;name&gt;          # delete the library called &lt;name&gt; and its directory
	-work &lt;name&gt;            # make &lt;name&gt; the current work library
	-lock                   # lock the work library
	-unlock                 # unlock the work library
	-tidy                   # tidy (erase) all out-of-date units in work
	-[no]verbose            # verbose listing (list units in each library)
	-[no]version            # display product version
values:
	-version : from ../../phoenix/config/phoenix.ini
	-help : from command line
configuration files:
	./phoenix.ini (not found)
	../../../phoenix.ini (not found)
	../../phoenix/config/phoenix.ini
</pre>

<p>Note the set of configuration files at the end.</p>

<p>This change also added extra messages to the file <code>messages/stlplus_messages.txt</code>.</p>

<h3>Added adjacent_arcs method to digraph</h3>

<p>The <code>digraph</code> class had a method for getting the arc that connects to nodes - its called
<code>adjacent_arc</code>. However, there may be more than one arc connecting two nodes, so I have added the
plural form <code>adjacent_arcs</code> which gets the set of all arcs connecting two nodes.</p>

<h3>More information in error_handler exceptions</h3>

<p>I've added more text to the exceptions thrown by <code>error_handler</code> for better diagnostics. This text
can be obtained by calling the <code>what</code> method of these exceptions which are derived from
<code>std::exception</code>.</p>

<h3>Added install path function to file_system</h3>

<p>The directory containing the current program can be obtained by calling the <code>install_path</code>
function. This function takes as its argument the <code>argv[0]</code> parameter from the <code>main</code> function.</p>

<h3>Added test in library_manager for successful saving of the INI files</h3>

<p>One of the options in the <code>library_manager</code> is to store library mappings in INI files managed by
the <code>ini_manager</code>. Previously, the save method of the <code>ini_manager</code> could fail to store the library
mappings (for example due to a read-only file) and the <code>library_manager</code> would not detect this. Now,
the <code>library_manager</code> <code>save_mappings</code> method returns false if this fails.</p>

<h3>Added portability fixes for Borland compiler to os_fixes</h3>

<p>This header should be included as the first include in every source file to eliminate
compiler-specific portabilty issues.</p>

<p>I've disabled some of the more irritating warnings from the Borland compiler by adding pragmas to
<code>os_fixes.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>I've also mapped the Borland <code>__FUNC__</code> macro onto the more generic
<code>__FUNCTION__</code> macro used by gcc and Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>Tidied up exception throwing code in persistent</h3>

<p>The way I was handling exceptions in the <code>persistent</code> functions for polymorphous types was simply
clumsy. I've reworked it to be cleaner.</p>

<h3>Added recognition of the Borland compiler version</h3>

<p>The <code>stlplus_build</code> function in <code>stlplus.hpp</code> returns a string representing the build parameters (OS,
compiler and compiler version). This now recognises the Borland compiler.</p>

<h3>Class quadruple removed</h3>

<p>Class <code>quadruple</code> is a continuation of the sequence <code>pair</code>/<code>triple</code>. However, I discovered that the name
caused a conflict on Solaris. The name <code>quad</code> is also taken. For the moment I have simply removed the
source files. I expect to reintroduce this class when I find a non-conflicting name.</p>

<h3>Improved the display_bytes function</h3>

<p>The <code>display_bytes</code> function in <code>string_utilities</code> displays a byte count in a user-friendly form (e.g
2.1MB). I've reworked it to give more consistent precision across the range.</p>

<h3>Tidied up TextIO</h3>

<p>TextIO was a bit of a mess because of many additions over the years. I have done a major tidy up
and as part of this have merged the textio_buffers.hpp and .cpp files into the main textio.hpp and
.cpp files. This will only effect you if you had created new TextIO derivates yourself.</p>

<h3>Added Test for Byte Order to os_fixes</h3>

The new function <code>little_endian</code> has been added to os_fixes.hpp. This can be called to
determine the byte ordering of a CPU. The issue is explained in the documentation for data
persistence.</h3>

<h3>Portability work</h3>

<p>A number of changes have been made to make the library more portable. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed assumptions about the size of integer types to ease portability to 64-bit CPUs.</li>
<li>Removed assumption that pointers can be cast to integers and vice-versa. This was used a lot in
the persistence routines for both pointers and iterators.</li>
<li>Used std::string::size_type instead of unsigned for string indexing. This was causing a number
of bugs to show up on 64-bit CPUs.</li>
<li>Rewrote the infinite-precision integer type (inf) to be more portable. This has changed the
representation of inf in the data persistence format.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Incremented the Data Persistence Version</h3>

<p>The changes to inf to make it portable have changed its data persistence format. The persistence
format version has been incremented to 2 as a result. Version 1 files will still be read correctly.
New files will be written as version 2.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v1.4">Changes from Version 1.4 to 2.0</h2>

<h3>Move to SourceForge</h3>

<p>The version was incremented from 1.4 to 2.0 to make this the official first version of the
library on SourceForge.</p>

<h3>Change of License</h3>

<p>I decided that the GPL was too restrictive for this library. I have changed the license to the
<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v1.3">Changes from Version 1.3 to 1.4</h2>

<h3>Bug fix - removed assumption that char is signed</h3>

<p>I had problems with native builds on Windows using gcc that forced me to
use <code>unsigned char</code> as the default type for <code>char</code>. This in turn uncovered a
subtle bug in <code>inf.cpp</code> and a common-mode bug in <code>string_utilities.cpp</code> where <code>char</code>
was assumed to be <code>signed</code>. Fixed by using an intermediate <code>int</code> to avoid <code>char</code>
completely.</p>

<h3>Preparation for Open Source Publication</h3>

<p>All source has been checked to ensure it has correct Author
field and a License field has been added. The license has been added to the
documentation in file <a href="license.html">license.html</a>. I have chosen
the GPL as the most appropriate license for now although I may downgrade this
to the Lesser GPL if the GPL proves too onerous to users.</p>

<h3>16 January 2004 - Version 1.4 frozen</h3>

<p>This version has been frozen as an official release 1.4. This is the last
release hosted within ECS. The version number will be incremented to 2.0 which
marks the start of the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/stlplus">SourceForge</a>
hosted open-source version. As the changes above show, some of the preparation
work for the open-source version are part of this version.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v1.2">Changes from Version 1.2 to 1.3</h2>

<h3>Error Handler Message Formats can now be in the Message File</h3>

<p>In previous versions, the message formatting strings were hard-coded into
the <code>error_handler</code> and could only be overridden from C++ source code. I have
now added the ability to ovverride the format strings from within the message
file itself.</p>

<h3>You can now go up many levels of directory in one call</h3>

<p>The <code>folder_up</code> function in <code>file_system.hpp</code> now takes an optional second
argument specifying how many levels to go up. The default is 1 for
compatibility with older versions.</p>

<h3>Added new display functions for bytes and time</h3>

<p>I have added two extra functions to <code>string_utilities.hpp</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>display_bytes</code> displays a number representing a byte-count in user-readable
form - e.g. 10kB rather than 10240.</li>
<li><code>display_time</code> displays a number representing elapsed seconds in
user-readable form - e.g. 1:00:00 rather than 3600</li>
</ul>

<p>This function is now used to display elapsed time in the CPU timer.</p>

<h3>Persistent Iterators Added</h3>

<p>I have added persistence functions for the iterators in <code>digraph</code> and <code>ntree</code>
only. I have not added them to <code>hash</code> because it is bad practice to store
iterators to hash table elements (they can be invalidated by rehashing at any
time).</p>

<p>I have not added persistence of iterators for STL types because there is
insufficient access available to implement them.</p>

<h3>Added new file system functions</h3>

<p>I've added the following functions to <code>file_system.hpp</code>:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>folder_set_current</code></dt>
<dd>Allows the current working directory to be changed</dd>

<dt><code>folder_elements</code></dt>
<dd>splits a folder path into its string elements</dd>

<dt><code>filespec_elements</code></dt>
<dd>as above for a filespec</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Added sleep function</h3>

<p>In <code>os_fixes.hpp</code> I have added the function <code>sleep(seconds)</code> for Windows. This is
a standard system function on Unix, so this function makes it portable to Windows.</p>

<h3>Fixed a bug in error handler</h3>

<p>The problem was with context messages. The idea of context messages is
that, if you are doing something recursive, an error can be meaningless unless
it is given some context - such as the key parts of the call stack. So, the
idea is that you push a context message into the <code>error_handler</code>'s context stack
as you go down the recursion. Then, when an error occurs, the error message is
supported by contextual messages that make it more meaningful.</p>

<p>It turns out that most of the time, contextual messages aren't used. If no
errors occur during the recursion, no messages get printed and so no context
messages are used.</p>

<p>The bug was that, if you used the context functions (<code>push_context</code>,
<code>auto_push_context</code>), the contextual message was created at the time of the
call. If the message was a positional message, this caused the source file
(e.g. a VHDL source file) relating to the context to be loaded. Since most of
the time the contextual message wasn't used, this was causing a significant
and unnecessary overhead,</p>

<p>The fix means that the contextual messages - and the supplemental messages
- are generated as late as possible to avoid this overhead.</p>

<h3>Fixed a conceptual error in error handler</h3>

<p>The concept of an auto-context was a bit wrong in the original design of
the error handler.</p>

<p>The idea of an auto-context is that you push the context stack at the start
of a block and an object stores the fact that you have done this. At the end
of the block the object is destroyed and this destruction automatically pops
the context stack. This means that it is easy to match push/pop pairs even in
the presence of multiple exit points or even exceptions.</p>

<p>In the original design, the object was a class which stored the state of
the error handler prior to the push and restored it on destruction. So far so
good. However, it had to be declared before use and then passed as a parameter
to be filled in:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
error_handler_context context;
auto_push_context(context, ...);
</pre>

<p>Not too bad, but clumsy. The real problem was that if a temporary copy of the object
was made for any reason, it would be destroyed prematurely and cause the
context to be popped prematurely.</p>

<p>The solution is to rework the concept so that the object is pointed to by a
<a href="smart_ptr.html">smart pointer</a>. Thus, the object is not destroyed
until the last copy of the pointer is destroyed, thus eliminating the above
problem.</p>

<p>The data type of the context object is <code>error_context_body</code> and should never
be used directly. The pointer type is called <code>error_context</code> and this is the
type that should be used.</p>

<p>This redesign means that assignements can be used - these weren't possible
before because assignments create temporaries. Therefore the <code>auto_push_context</code>
methods have been redesigned to return the context:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
error_context context = auto_push_context(...);
</pre>

<p>This is much better C++. Note that I have also simplified the name. Since
you need to rework any code using auto-context then I thought this was an
opportunity to make the type name shorter.</p>

<h3>Reorganised error handler</h3>

<p>In the process of fixing the two problems above I did a reorganisation of
the error handler to hide more of the implementation from the user. Internal
data types are now mostly hidden.</p>

<p>I also renamed <code>error_handler_position</code> as <code>error_position</code> (but defined a
pseudonym of <code>error_handler_position</code> for backwards compatibility). I renamed
<code>error_handler_context</code> to be <code>error_context</code>. This does not have a pseudonym.
Because of the fix above, the use of the type has changed. It seemed to me
that any code using the type would need reworking anyway, so renaming the type
was no big deal.</p>

<h3>4 November 2003 - Version 1.3 frozen</h3>

<p>This version has been frozen as an official release 1.3 and the working
version incremented to 1.4.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="v1.1">Changes from Version 1.1 to 1.2</h2>

<h3>Fixed #include "os_fixes.hpp" throughout</h3>

<p>The intention is that every file should have <code>os_fixes.hpp</code> included as the
very first include to ensure portability between compilers. This intention
hadn't been maintained over the past few months. This fix ensures that every
header in STLplus includes <code>os_fixes.hpp</code> first.</p>

<h3>Added No-Copy Variant of smart_ptr</h3>

<p>A third variant of a smart pointer called 
<a href="smart_ptr.html"><code>smart_ptr_nocopy</code></a> has been added.
This is for managing classes that cannot or must not be copied.</p>

<p>I have also modified the <a href="library_manager.html"><code>library_manager</code></a>
and the <a href="textio.html">TextIO</a> subsystem to use
this class.</p>

<h3>Added Convenient short-cut functions for Persistence</h3>

<p>I have added short-cut functions to the 
<a href="persistence.html">persistence</a> functions that act as wrappers to do the whole job
of dumping or restoring a class in one function call. For example,
<code>dump_to_file</code> will perform the whole process of creating a dump context with an
output device of a file and then dumping a data structure to that file.</p>

<p>These functions are templates so that they can adapt to the class being
dumped.</p>

<h3>Added Installer Functions for Persistence</h3>

<p>When using <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a>
of polymorphic types you have to register each polymorphic subclass
with the dump or restore context. When writing software I tend to wrap up all
the registrations into a function. So I have added a register_all method to
the dump and restore context classes that takes such an "installer" function
as its argument. This is just a simple shortcut that made the writing of the
short-cut functions mentioned above possible.</p>

<h3>Made one-argument constructors explicit</h3>

<p>A one-parameter constructor is considered to be a type cast
and may be called <i>implicitly</i> by the
compiler. I have had problems where I used the wrong type in an expression (or
even the wrong const-ness) and
ended up with a temporary <code>library_manager</code> or <code>ini_manager</code> object being created
because these classes have one-parameter constructors. This was definitely
unwanted behaviour. The problem is that C++ compilers are over-enthusiastic
about trying to find implicit casts like this.</p>

<p>The solution is to make the constructors <code>explicit</code>. I have done
this for the 
<a href="library_manager.html"><code>library_manager</code></a> and 
<a href="ini_manager.html"><code>ini_manager</code></a> so far. Note also the
documentation on the infinite precision integer type 
<a href="inf.html"><code>inf</code></a> which has explicit constructors throughout - this was
done some time ago to avoid the same problem, at the cost of significant
utility in using the package - unfortunately the compiler became over-fond of
creating <code>inf</code>s where they were not wanted.</p>

<h3>Solaris Support</h3>

<p>A slight adjustment was required to the includes of system headers in order
to build STLplus on the Solaris operating system. This has no effect
whatsoever on the users of the library.</p>

<p>Solaris is now a <a href="porting.html">supported port</a> for STLplus. It requires -DSOLARIS to be
defined in the <a href="building.html">compilation</a> phase.</p>

<p>You also need to link with the socket library (-lsocket with gcc). This is
done for you if you're using my make system.</p>

<h3>Added the Interface Concept</h3>

<p>I have started to use the Java concept of 
<a href="interfaces.html">interfaces</a> in the STLplus
library.</p>

<h3>Made the template containers compatible with Visual Studio version 7.1 (.NET 2003)</h3>

<p>This version of Microsoft's compiler is stricter about the use of the
<code>typename</code> keyword. Where a method parameter is a type defined
within the template class, this version of VS requires the typename keyword to
be used. To prevent problems with other compilers I've used the macro
PARAMETER_TYPENAME to insert this only for VS7.1.</p>

<h3>Created compiler-specific macros in os_fixes.hpp</h3>

<p>I have added some macros to handle the different "fussiness" of different
compilers over the use of the <code>typename</code> keyword. As mentioned
above, Visual Studio 7.1 requires them in method parameters. Gnu's gcc version
3 requires them in <code>typedef</code> declarations where the type being
referenced is a template instance. See the <code>digraph</code> or
<code>ntree</code> source code for examples.</p>

<p>These differences have been centralised so that all incompatibilities
between compilers are handled by declarations in os_fixes.hpp.</p>

<h3>Complete Rework of Conversions from Numeric Types to their String Representations</h3>

<p>This affects <code>string_utilities</code> and <code>inf</code>.</p>

<p>A couple of bugs were found in to_string for numeric types. There was also
a legacy problem with the interpretation of the alignment and padding
parameters. I have reworked the code to eliminate the bug and whilst doing it
I have rationalised the interface.</p>

<p>I have also ensured that the reverse conversions to_int, to_uint etc. are
compatible with the to_string conversions. This applies to all numeric types
defined by C++ and also my inf type.</p>

<p>The old interface was:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string to_string(<i>type</i> value, unsigned radix, radix_display_t display,
                      alignment_t alignment, unsigned width, char pad);
</pre>

<p>The problem is that the field width and alignment do not belong here. I
redefined the width to mean the number of digits in the result and eliminated
the alignment and padding parameters. The new interface is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string to_string(<i>type</i> value, unsigned radix, radix_display_t display, unsigned width)
   throw(std::invalid_argument)
</pre>

<p>The function will throw the exception if you specify a radix outside the
range 2-36 or if the display parameter is not a valid value.</p>

<p>The reverse conversions can also throw an exception:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
<i>type</i> to_<i>type</i>(const std::string&amp;, unsigned radix = 0)
   throw(std::invalid_argument);
</pre>

<p>The exception will be thrown if the string is not a valid integer
format.</p>

<p>I've also removed the ability to set alignment and padding parameters for
integers in TextIO.</p>

<h3>Reworked the min/max Problem</h3>

<p>The STL defines template functions std::min and std::max. Microsoft defines
macros min and max. Visual Studio didn't provide std::min and std::max prior
to version 7. Now both templates and macros are defined. This can cause
portability problems. There is an attempt to fix this in
<code>os_fixes.hpp</code> but I have also defined template functions
<code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> that you can use to avoid this
issue completely.</p>

<h3>Minor Mods to TCP</h3>

<p>Users (namely ACW and DJDM) have added two things to the TCP classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A timeout when connecting a client to a server</li>
<li>Methods for accessing the address and port values that a client is using</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a bug-fix for Windows.</p>

<h3>Added Quadruple</h3>

<p>This is the next in the series:</p>

<ul>
<li>pair (STL)</li>
<li>triple (STLplus)</li>
<li>quadruple (STLplus)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self-Checking Iterators</h3>

<p>The iterators for the STLplus container classes
<a href="digraph.html"><code>digraph</code></a>,
<a href="hash.html"><code>hash</code></a> and 
<a href="ntree.html"><code>ntree</code></a> now have consistency checking code to
detect common iterator misuse. Many of the methods in these classes can now
throw one of three exceptions - wrong_object, null_dereference and
end_dereference. See the documentation on 
<a href="exceptions.html#common">exceptions</a>
for an explanation.</p>

<h3>Extra File Operations</h3>

<p>I have added the functions file_copy and file_move to
<a href="file_system.html">file_system.hpp</a>. The file_copy function, as it
says, copies one file to another. The file_move function tries to rename the
old file to become the new file, but if that fails it copies the file and
deletes the original.</p>

<h3>Subprocesses and signals</h3>

<p>The subprocess classes used to treat the case of the child being
interrupted by a signal as an error. This messed up the error_text function
because the status value was not a proper error number. It seems to me that
this case is in fact an exit not an error - the error handling is supposed to
be related to errors in the parent trying to manage the child, not errors in
the child. so I now set the exit status to the number of the signal. This
means that the subprocess appears to exit with non-zero status.</p>

<p>You can now get the error number as a number, not just as a string.</p>

<h3>6 June 2003 - Version 1.2 frozen</h3>

<p>This version has been frozen as an official release 1.2 and the working
version incremented to 1.3. The differences reported by CVS amounted to 10k
lines of output!</p>
