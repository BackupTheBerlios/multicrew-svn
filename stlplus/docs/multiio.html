<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The MultiIO package provides a set of TextIO devices that support multiple
input and output streams.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to create a log file
that contains everything written to standard output. The solution would be to
use a multiple output device connected to both standard output and a file
device for the log file. Then, use the multiple output device for all
output.</p>

<p>The MultiIO output device is parallel - everything written to the device is
replicated to all attached devices. The input device however is sequential -
each attached device is read in turn.</p>

<h2 id="outputs">Output Devices</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Multiple output devices route text output to any number of attached output
devices. The same text is sent to all of the attached devices. There is in
principle no limit to the number of devices that can be attached in this way,
although in practice it is hard to imagine more than two being used. The most
obvious use for the multiple output device is to produce a log file that
contains a copy the text printed to standard output.</p>

<p>For example, consider the <a href="error_handler.hpp">Error Handler</a>
component that can be used to produce text messages. It has the following
interface:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class error_handler
{
public:
  ...
  error_handler(otext&amp; device,unsigned limit = 0,bool show = true);
  ...
  bool information(const std::string&amp; id) throw(id_error,format_error);
  ...
  bool warning(const std::string&amp; id) throw(id_error,format_error);
  ...
  bool error(const std::string&amp; id) throw(id_error,format_error,limit_error);
  ...
};
</pre>

<p>The constructor takes as its argument an <tt>otext</tt> object - this is
the superclass of all output devices and this means that any output device can
be used. Normally, this might be constructed using the standard error (or output) as
the output device:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "error_handler.hpp"
#include "fileio.hpp"
...
error_handler errors(ferr);
</pre>

<p>The <tt>ferr</tt> object is a pre-defined instance of an output file device (class
<tt>oftext</tt>, which is a subclass of <tt>otext</tt>) attached to standard error.</p>

<p>However, this approach doesn't create a log file. How can this be done? The
error handler itself does not provide this functionality. Is the error handler
disfunctional? Should I rewrite it to provide log-file support? Should I
rewrite every other component to provide log-file support just in case I need
it? This would be the traditional approach and its about as naff as a
Microsoft product. The answer is so much simpler than this
- create a multi-output device attached to both standard error and the log
file. Then pass that multi-output device to the error handler as its output
device. Here's the code:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "error_handler.hpp"
#include "fileio.hpp"
#include "multiio.hpp"
...
oftext log("messages.log");
omtext output(ferr,log);
error_handler errors(output);
</pre>

<p>The first line (excluding the includes) creates an output file device
called <tt>log</tt> which is connected to the file <tt>messages.log</tt>. A
multi-output device of class <tt>omtext</tt> and called <tt>output</tt> is
then created which is connected to two devices - <tt>ferr</tt> (connected to
standard error) and <tt>log</tt>. This multi-output device is then passed to
the error handler.</p>

<p>The end result is that every line of text produced by the error handler will go
both to standard error and to the log file.</p>

<p>The elegance of this solution is that this logging feature has been added
by simply changing a couple of lines of code. The rest of the program needs no
changes and no other part of the program needs to know that output is being
logged.</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>The interface to the multi-output device class <tt>omtext</tt> is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class omtext : public otext
{
public:
  omtext(void);
  omtext(const otext&amp;);
  omtext(const otext&amp;, const otext&amp;);
  void open(const otext&amp;);
  void open(const otext&amp;, const otext&amp;);
  unsigned add(const otext&amp;);

  unsigned device_count(void) const;
  otext&amp; device_get(unsigned);
  const otext&amp; device_get(unsigned) const;
};
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> this is a subclass of <tt>otext</tt> and so inherits all the
functionality of its superclass.</p>

<p>The atomic operations for setting up a multi-output device are the first
constructor and the <tt>add</tt> method. The constructor sets up a
multi-output device with no attached devices. The <tt>add</tt> method can then
be called any number of times to attach devices. The example above could be
rewritten to use only these atomic operations:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "error_handler.hpp"
#include "fileio.hpp"
#include "multiio.hpp"
...
oftext log("messages.log");
omtext output;
output.add(ferr);
output.add(log);
error_handler errors(output);
</pre>

<p>The other functions are composite operations that provide convenient
shortcuts. The two extra constructors create a multi-output device and add one
or two attached devices respectively. The <tt>open</tt> methods close the
device and recreate it with one or two attached devices respectively. Finally,
the <tt>device_count</tt> and <tt>device_get</tt> methods provide access to
the attached devices, should that ever prove necessary.</p>

<p>Devices are numbered from <tt>0</tt> to <tt>device_count()-1</tt>, using
the normal C++ conventions for arrays. When a device is added, its index
number is returned from the <tt>add</tt> function. It can be accessed by
calling <tt>device_get</tt> using that index number. Alternatively, all the
devices can be accessed by using a <tt>for</tt> loop:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; output.device_count(); i++)
{
  otext&amp; device = output.device_get(i);
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="inputs">Input Devices</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Multiple-input devices are somewhat different to multiple-output devices.
They are sequential rather than parallel. This means that each inpout device
is read in turn until it indicates end-of-file. Then the next device is read
and so on, until all devices have indicated end-of-file. Only then does the
MultiIO input device indicate end-of-file. The effect is to concatenate all of
the input devices attached to the multiple-input device.</p>

<p>As this description suggests, the purpose of the multiple-input device is
to concatenate different devices. This is not limited to file devices - it is
possible to concatenate, say, a file with an internet connection. For example,
a header file could be added before the start of a web page and a footer file
could be added after the end of a web page. From the viewpoint of the program
using the multiple-input device they would all appear concatenated as a single
file.</p>

<p>The main limitation of this approach is that all devices attached to the
multiplt-input device must be opened before they are attached. This could be a
problem if there is a limit on the number of opened devices. For example, most
operating systems limit the number of files that can be opened at once and
most web servers limit the number of connections that can be opened from a
single client at once. Nevertheless, the multiple-input device can
occasionally be useful.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how to use a multiple-input device to concatenate the
set of all files specified from the command line and print them on standard output:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "fileio.hpp"
#include "multiio.hpp"
...
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  ...
  // create the muli-input device
  imtext input;
  // add all the input files to it
  for (unsigned i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)
  {
    iftext file(argv[i])
    input.add(file);
  }
  // pipe it all to the output
  fout << input;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>There is no error handling in this example - if a file doesn't exist, it
will appear to be just a zero-length file and no errors will be reported. You
might want to add some error reporting to test whether a file opened
successfully:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
  for (unsigned i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)
  {
    iftext file(argv[i])
    if (file.error())
    {
       // report error
       ...
    }
    else
      input.add(file);
  }
</pre>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>The interface to the multi-input device class <tt>imtext</tt> is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class imtext : public itext
{
public:
  imtext(void);
  imtext(const itext&amp;);
  imtext(const itext&amp;, const itext&amp;);
  void open(const itext&amp;);
  void open(const itext&amp;, const itext&amp;);
  unsigned add(const itext&amp;);

  unsigned device_count(void) const;
  itext&amp; device_get(unsigned);
  const itext&amp; device_get(unsigned) const;
};
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> this is a subclass of <tt>itext</tt> and so inherits all the
functionality of its superclass.</p>

<p>This is very similar to the multi-output device, so the following is a
cut'n'paste'n'edit of that description.</p>

<p>The atomic operations for setting up a multi-input device are the first
constructor and the <tt>add</tt> method. The constructor sets up a
multi-input device with no attached devices. The <tt>add</tt> method can then
be called any number of times to attach ainput devices. The example above is
in fact written to use only these atomic operations</p>

<p>The other functions are composite operations that provide convenient
shortcuts. The two extra constructors create a multi-input device and add one
or two attached devices respectively. The <tt>open</tt> methods close the
device and recreate it with one or two attached devices respectively. Finally,
the <tt>device_count</tt> and <tt>device_get</tt> methods provide access to
the attached devices, should that ever prove necessary.</p>

<p>Devices are numbered from <tt>0</tt> to <tt>device_count()-1</tt>, using
the normal C++ conventions for arrays. When a device is added, its index
number is returned from the <tt>add</tt> function. It can be accessed by
calling <tt>device_get</tt> using that index number. Alternatively, all the
devices can be accessed by using a <tt>for</tt> loop:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; input.device_count(); i++)
{
  itext&amp; device = input.device_get(i);
  ...
