<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>These are a set of basic rules to try to minimise the incompatibilities in
interfaces between different people's code by adopting a standard set of
coding rules and guidelines. They are intended to be a minimum set since I
don't see the point in dictating silly things like code layout. </p>

<p>Anything not specified here leaves you free to code how you like. Unless I
add it later.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="1">1. Use the STL</h2>

<p>Basic data structures should be implemented using the STL template classes
wherever they are appropriate. Most of these are Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
implemented using templates but there are other less-used headers too. You
should not write your own list structures, sets etc.</p>

<p>String processing should use the STL string type in preference to
char*.</p>

<p>The STL provides:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<tr><td>string</td><td>dynamic string type</td></tr>
<tr><td>vector</td><td>dynamic array ADT</td></tr>
<tr><td>list</td><td>basic list ADT </td></tr>
<tr><td>deque</td><td>double-ended queue ADT</td></tr>
<tr><td>map</td><td>associative storage ADT</td></tr>
<tr><td>multimap</td><td>as map ADT but with multiple entries per key</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>associative storage ADT</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset</td><td>as set ADT but with multiple entries per key</td></tr>
<tr><td>algorithm</td><td>sorts, searches etc. acting on ADTs</td></tr>
<tr><td>functional</td><td>predicates etc. acting on ADTs</td></tr>
<tr><td>iostream</td><td>I/O system - but see notes below on I/O</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are a number of books around on using the STL. Some of them are even
worth reading.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="2">2. Use STLplus</h2>

<p>The STLplus library has three objectives: it extends the STL by providing
extra template classes; it deals with portability issues as discussed in the
section <a href="#9">"Make your code portable"</a>;
it provides a lot of utilities which you will find useful (and that is an
order!).</p>

<p>As this documentation is now part of the STLplus documentation, I need say
no more!</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="3">3. I/O System</h2>

<p>In C++ you have a choice between three I/O systems (unistd from C, stdio
from C and iostream from C++). This can cause incompatible interfaces.
Therefore we should standardise on one.</p>

<p>I believe the fourth choice is the best, this being the STLplus TextIO
system. This is similar to and has all the advantages of the C++ iostream
classes but with some major advantages too. In particular, it allows I/O to be
redirected and doesn't assume that input or output text comes from a file. All
the components in STLplus that use I/O or provide printing facilities do so
through TextIO, so standardising to this package ensures consistency not only
between different people's code, but with STLplus itself.</p>

<p>If you've
used iostream, then you already know how to use most of TextIO. The online
documentation will fill in the rest.</p>

<p>There is also support in the STLplus library for a binary dump format. This
will not be mandated, but will be recommended. See the <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a> functions
for details.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="4">4. Modularise</h2>

<p>The recommendation is to have one subsystem declared per header. A
subsystem may be a class, with possibly sub-classes declared in the same
header. Or it could be a collection of closely-related functions. For that
matter it could be one function. The header file should have the same name as
the subsystem (no naff abbreviations, you're not limited to 8 letter filenames
anymore) with the extension .hpp or .h (its up to you which convention you
choose) for C++ headers and .h for C-only headers.</p>

<p>Source code should be contained in a file with the same name as the header
but with a .cpp extension for C++ and a .c extension for C-only.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="5">5. #Include Rules</h2>

<p>Include only the minimum set of headers in a header file needed to make all
the types used in the header available. Any additional headers needed in the
C++ body should be included in the body file. This minimises the number of
includes that someone including your header will inherit from you and is
considered friendly.</p>

<p>Use a sentinel within each header so that the includes in a file become
order independent. A sentinel puts a pre-processor conditional around the
whole header file which means that, no matter how many times it is included,
the contents will only be included once. At the very start of the file (I mean
lines 1 and 2), for a header called my_stuff.h, the sentinel would look like
this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#ifndef MY_STUFF_H
#define MY_STUFF_H
</pre>

<p>and at the
very end of the file (and I mean the very last line):</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#endif
</pre>

<p>The name of the sentinel here is created by uppercasing the filename and
changing the dot to an underscore. Some people add a double leading underscore
on the name. This is perfectly acceptable. The aim is to ensure that all
sentinel names are different. The second style is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#ifndef __MY_STUFF_H
#define __MY_STUFF_H
</pre>

<p>Finally, never include the &quot;using namespace std&quot; clause in a
header. All STL classes referred to in the header should have the std::
namespace prefix added - for example, string should be referred to as
std::string within headers. The reason for this rule is that it is considered
unfriendly to people who may wish to include your header in their code to dump
all of the std namespace into their code against their wishes, which is what
the using... clause does.</p>

<p>In body files, you are free to do what you like with namespaces, since
no-one includes body files. By the way, the preferred way of including a C++
system header is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;string&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note the lack of an extension.</p>

<p>Also note that for C system headers, there are two forms. The normal form
still works:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is just as in C and makes the stdlib functions and types available.
However, you can drop the &quot;.h&quot; and add a &quot;c&quot; prefix and it
puts the header into the std:: namespace:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you now add the "using namespace std" then you're back to where you
started, but you could alternatively refer to the contents of stdlib with the
std:: prefix. </p>

<p>That's not a rule, I just thought you'd like to know.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="6">6. Exceptions</h2>

<p>Exceptions should only be used for error conditions. They should not be
part of the normal execution path of a program. It may seem that an exception
can be used to return a value of a different type from a program, but this is
extremely bad practice. In particular, compiler writers are under absolutely
no obligation whatsoever to make exception handling fast.</p>

<p>Mere user errors or input errors should be indicated by returning an
appropriate value from a function, setting a flag, dropping out of a loop or
other 'normal' C++ operations.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="7">7. New/Delete versus Malloc/Free</h2>

<p>You should always <tt>delete</tt> an object created using <tt>new</tt> and
always <tt>free</tt> an object created using <tt>malloc</tt>. This is because
the C++ memory manager is not guaranteed to be compatible with the C memory
manager, even though it usually is. Note there is a difference between
"guaranteed" and "usually". Just because "it works" with your compiler does
not make it correct.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <tt>realloc</tt> should only be used on memory
allocated with <tt>malloc</tt>, never memory created with <tt>new</tt>.</p>

<p>We need to keep open the possibility of adding a cached memory manager in
the future to speed up <tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> which could make them
incompatible with <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt>.</p>

<p>The easiest way of ensuring this rule is to only use <tt>new</tt> and
<tt>delete</tt> and consider <tt>malloc</tt>, <tt>realloc</tt> and
<tt>free</tt> to be obsolete, which of course they are.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="8">8. No Static Objects</h2>

<p>We may wish to repackage some or all of our code as a shared library (DLL
in Windows-speak) so all code should really be written with this possibility
in mind. There can be problems with globals (specifically class globals which
need to be constructed) in shared libraries and these problems vary between
operating systems (portability rearing its beautiful head again). </p>

<p>My preference is to try to avoid the problem by avoiding statics
altogether. This is easy when you start from scratch, but with legacy code it
is not always as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Fortunately, basic types such as bool, int and all pointers are not
affected by this problem. Thus, if you <i>really</i> must have a global class
object, make it a global pointer to a class object and dynamically allocate
the object on first use:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
static my_stuff* stuff = 0;

bool do_something_now(...)
{
  if (!stuff) stuff = new my_stuff(...);
    ...
}
</pre>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="9">9. Make your code portable</h2>

<p><i>Everyone</i> is responsible for writing portable code at all times. It
is <i>not</i> an SEP (someone else's problem). The only code that does not
need to be portable is the GUI. There are three issues relating to
portability:</p>

<h3>1) Portability between compilers</h3>

<p>On Windows
we use Visual C++, on Unix we'll be using Gnu's gcc. Therefore all code must
compile with both compilers. In practice this is pretty easy since there are
only slight differences between them.</p>

<p>You do need to take compiler portability into account when
structuring your directories for storing source code. There is a standard make
file for use with gcc which will work across all platforms and you are strongly
recommended to use that. However, it does impose some rules on how you
structure your source:</p>

<p>Each project should be in a directory with the same name as
the project (no spaces in the name). Then, beneath that, there needs to be a
directory called "source". All source files should be in that subdirectory and
there should be no further source code subdirectories below that.</p>

<p>Following these conventions means that switching between
compilation systems will be easier than falling off a dog.</p>

<p>You can test for compiler portability by installing gcc for
Windows. This is available using a Unix emulation on Windows which is known as
"Cygwin". I have installers for this if you want to use it.</p>

<h3>2) Portability between Run-time Libraries</h3>

<p>You should
only use standard library functions - ANSI C run-time library and the standard
C++ run-time library. You should not use any other system calls. Nor should you
use any extensions to the libraries, such as extra classes that a compiler
vendor may have added to the STL. Nor should you use non-standard 'features' of
the standard library functions.</p>

<p>However,
bear in mind that one of the purposes of the STLplus library is to plug holes
left by this rule.</p>

<h3>3) Portability between Operating Systems</h3>

<p>Rule (2)
goes a long way to meeting this rule, but there are some things that you have
to do which are different between Windows and Unix. The two specific areas that
could affect our development are in file-system handling and in subprocess handling.
These are solved by using the STLplus library (see above) headers
file_system.hpp and subprocesses.hpp respectively. These implement both a
Windows and a Unix version of these subsystems accessed through a
platform-independent interface.</p>

<p>If you
need to add other functionality that is platform-specific, then you are
responsible for providing a Unix and a Windows implementation. You should
encapsulate (that means hide) it behind a common platform-independent interface
in the same way as the above STLPLus subsystems. There should therefore be no
&quot;#ifdef WIN32&quot; or other platform-specific compiler switches anywhere
else in your application code.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="10">10. Avoid the C Runtime Library</h2>

<p>The truth is that the C runtime library is obsolete. Practically all of the
functionality of the C runtime is provided in a better, more effective and
more robust form in the C++ runtime library. For example, the I/O routines of
stdio are superceded and vastly improved by iostream and by the STLplus TextIO
classes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are some functions in the C runtime that are positively
<i>dangerous</i> and should never be used. Their existence in a program is
positive proof of an incompetent programmer. An example is the monster called
sprintf. Let me explain why this should never, ever, ever <i>ever</i> be used.
Ever.</p>

<p>First look at the interface:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
int sprintf(char *, const char *, ...);
</pre>

<p>The first argument is a char* buffer to print into. The function prints
text into this buffer according to the format string which is the second
argument and the argument-vector parameters represented by the elipsis (...).
What's missing is a parameter that tells sprintf how long the buffer is - so
it has no way of knowing if an overflow happens. If the buffer is not long
enough, then the function quite happily runs off the end and corrupts other
data structures in memory. This kind of memory bug is extremely difficult to
diagnose and fix. A common bodge (yes, it is a bodge, not a solution) is to
simply make the buffer very large. However, that just pushes the problem
further away, it doesn't fix it. Consider the case where one of the parameters
in the format string is a command-line argument. You as a programmer have no
control over the length of this argument. Therefore you have no way of
deciding how big the buffer should be. Any "guess" at the size is a bodge.</p>

<p>Both iostream and TextIO provide functions for formatting text in a string
that has no potential overflow problems. Therefore there is no justifiable use
for sprintf.</p>

<p>Note also that rule <a href="#7">7</a> explained why malloc/free/realloc
are obsolete and potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>Just about the only useful C header left is ctype.h which defines
classifying functions for char. For example, you test isdigit(ch) to see if
the character is a digit (0 to 9). Even these functions though should be
superceded by the C++ locale classes which provide classifications relevant to
the user's spoken language.</p>
