<p>FileIO is a customisation of TextIO for file I/O using the functionality
provided by the ANSI C standard stdio.h package. The basic type defined by the
stdio package is the pointer type FILE* and this is the type used by FileIO to
implement text I/O to and from files. The implementation is very tight in that
FileIO and stdio can co-exist in the same code without conflict (eat dirt,
iostream!). This is achieved by using the built-in buffering scheme provided by
stdio so that there is no internal state in the FileIO device. There is even an
implicit type conversion to FILE* so that a text output file device can be used
as the target for an fprintf() statement.</p>

<h2 id="outputs">Output Files</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The most common and simplest way of using file output devices is to used the
derived class oftext. This is a derivation of otext that does nothing more than
provide a cleaner and more file-orientated interface to file-input devices. For
example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">oftext my_output_file("results.txt");</pre>

<p>Once an output device has been opened, it can be used as the base class otext
device, giving access to all of the output chevron operators (&lt;&lt;). See the
TextIO Documentation for details.</p>

<p>The oftext device provides a set of constructors and open() and close()
functions that simply perform the low-level operations on the otext base class
for you. There is no stored state in the oftext derivation (derived devices
never have stored state - the buffer completely defines the behaviour). The
interface is partly defined by otext, since oftext inherits all of the otext
member functions. The additional functionality is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">oftext (void); </pre>

<p>The void constructor creates an uninitialised device.</p>

<pre class="cpp">oftext (FILE*); </pre>

<p>This constructor takes an already-opened FILE* handle and attaches it to the
output buffer. It is assumed that any customisation, for example setting up of
buffering, has been done by the calling program. It is also assumed that the
file will be closed by the calling program since otherwise the other constructor
would be used. This is known as an unmanaged file. This constructor is
particularly useful for attaching the standard output and error handles stdout
and stderr to a FileIO device so that TextIO formatting functions can be used on
them.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
oftext (const char*, size_t bufsize = preferred_buffer, open_t mode = overwrite);
oftext (const string&amp;, size_t bufsize = preferred_buffer, open_t mode = overwrite);
</pre>

<p>These two constructors are functionally identical, it is just convenient to
have a string version so that filenames in strings are handled simply. These
constructors create an output text device with an attached ofbuff which has been
constructed with the filename, buffer size and mode passed as parameters. The
file will be automatically opened and closed by the oftext device.</p>

<p>These constructors are the more commonly used one for named files. The first
argument is the filename. This is passed directly to the fopen() function to
open in write mode, so the rules for filenames are exactly the same as for
stdio. Since the buffer opens the file, it will also automatically close the
file when the device is either explicitly closed or the destructor is called.
The second argument is an optional buffer size. If greater than zero, the
built-in buffering scheme of stdio will be invoked to attach a buffer to the
output FILE*. The default is to buffer to the size of oftext::preferred_buffer,
in other words this is a static value defined in the scope of the oftext
class. Because the underlying buffering of stdio is used, FileIO and stdio are
guaranteed to be synchronised and therefore it is acceptable to intermix the two
packages even on buffered output files. The third argument is the mode of the
file which may be either otext::append or otext::overwrite. Note that these are
defined in the baseclass otext, not the FileIO derivative oftext.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void open (FILE*);
void open (const char*, size_t bufsize = preferred_buffer, open_t mode = overwrite);
void open (const string&amp;, size_t bufsize = p[referred_buffer, open_t mode = overwrite);
</pre>

<p>These open() functions allow an existing oftext device to be attached to a
new file. Any old file is first of all detached by calling the underlying
close() function from the base class otext.</p>

<p>Files are opened in text_output_native mode so that newlines ('\n') are
converted into the conventions for the current operating system. To switch modes
you should change the mode after the file has been opened using the baseclass
set_newline_mode() function.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
oftext my_output_file("results.txt");
my_output_file.set_newline_mode(textio_output_unix);
</pre>

<p>This example forces Unix conventions on the output file.</p>

<pre class="cpp">operator FILE* (void);</pre>

<p>This is the type-conversion operator to FILE* which allows the file handle
being managed by the oftext device to be accessed directly. This allows the
oftext device to be used directly as the target for fprintf() calls.</p>

<p>These customisation functions are specific to file-input devices only. They
do not apply to the base class otext nor to any other derivative. However, all
the functionality of the base class otext is available for use with oftext
objects, in particular the full set of chevron operators overloaded on the otext
class. Furthermore, an oftext device can be passed as a parameter to any
function that takes the base class otext as a parameter and indeed it is
recommended that all print routines are customised for the base class otext and
not any derivative. Derived class objects should only be used as parameters
where the extended functionality of that derivative is specifically required
within the function being called.</p>

<h3>Usage with Base Class otext</h3>

<p>The ofbuff buffer can be used directly with the TextIO input base class
otext:</p>

<pre class="cpp">otext my_output_file = new ofbuff("results.txt"); </pre>

<p>This example defines a new otext object - an output text device - and
initialises it with an ofbuff buffer. This customises the otext device for file
output. The ofbuff buffer is in turn initialised by its second constructor which
takes three arguments - the first is the filename and in this case is
"results.txt"; the second is the buffer size to use and has been left as the
default value. Since the mode is not specified, the default overwrite mode will
be used.</p>

<p>In practice the input base class otext is only used when it is desired to
switch between different customisations.</p>

<h2 id="inputs">Input Files</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Input files are used in a very similar way to output files.</p>

<p>The most common way of using file input devices is to used the derived class
iftext. This is a derivation of itext. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">iftext my_input_file("data.txt");</pre>

<p>The iftext device provides a set of constructors and open() functions that
simply perform the low-level operations to open and close files. The interface
is almost completely defined by itext, since iftext inherits all of the itext
member functions. The additional functionality is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">iftext (void);</pre>

<p>The void constructor creates an uninitialised device.</p>

<pre class="cpp">iftext (FILE*);</pre>

<p>This constructor takes an already-opened FILE* handle and attaches it to the
input buffer. It is assumed that any customisation, for example setting up of
buffering, has been done by the calling program. It is also assumed that the
file will be closed by the calling program and not by FileIO since otherwise the
other constructor would be used. This constructor is particularly useful for
attaching the standard input handle stdin to a FileIO device so that TextIO
formatting functions can be used on it.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iftext (const char*, size_t bufsize = preferred_buffer);
iftext (const string&amp;, size_t bufsize = preferred_buffer);
</pre>

<p>These constructors are the more commonly used one for named files. The first
argument is the filename. This is passed directly to the fopen() function to
open in read mode, so the rules for filenames are exactly the same as for
stdio. Since the buffer opens the file, it will also automatically close the
file when the device is either explicitly closed or the destructor is called.
The second argument is an optional buffer size. If greater than zero, the
built-in buffering scheme of stdio will be invoked to attach a buffer to the
input FILE*. Because the underlying buffering of stdio is used, FileIO and stdio
are guaranteed to be synchronised and therefore it is acceptable to intermix the
two packages even on buffered input files.  The default buffer size will be
suitable for most applications so in practice there is no need to specify a
buffer size. The only exception is if you want unbuffered input (very slow) in
which case a size of 0 should be specified.</p>

<p>Note the convention for opening and closing files. If the FileIO opens the
file, it will also close it. If the file is already open, then it will be left
open when the FileIO device is destroyed.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void open (FILE*);
void open (const char*, size_t bufsize = TEXTIO_PREFERRED_SIZE);
void open (const string&amp;, size_t bufsize = TEXTIO_PREFERRED_SIZE);
</pre>

<p>These open() functions allow an existing iftext device to be attached to a
new file. Any old file is first of all detached by calling the underlying
close() function from the base class itext.</p>

<pre class="cpp">operator FILE* (void);</pre>

<p>This is the type-conversion operator to FILE* which allows the file handle
being managed by the iftext device to be accessed directly. This allows the
iftext device to be used directly as the target for fscanf() calls.</p>

<p>These customisation functions are specific to file-input devices only. They
do not apply to the base class itext nor to any other derivative. However, all
the functionality of the base class itext is available for use with iftext
objects, in particular the full set of chevron operators overloaded on the itext
class. Furthermore, an iftext device can be passed as a parameter to any
function that takes the base class itext as a parameter and indeed it is
recommended that all input routines are customised for the base class itext and
not any derivative. Derived class objects should only be used as parameters
where the extended functionality of that derivative is specifically required
within the function being called.</p>

<h3>Usage with Base Class itext</h3>

<p>The ifbuff buffer can be used directly with the TextIO input base class
itext:</p>

<pre class="cpp">itext my_input_file = new ifbuff("data.txt"); </pre>

<p>This example defines a new itext object - an input text device - and
initialises it with an ifbuff buffer. This customises the itext device for file
input. The ifbuff buffer is in turn initialised by its second constructor which
takes two arguments - the first is the filename and in this case is "data.txt";
the second is the buffer size to use and in this case is not specified, giving
the default value.</p>

<p>In practice the input base class itext is only used when it is desired to
switch between different customisations. For example, you may wish to define an
input device and then in an if statement either open it with a file-input buffer
as above or alternatively open it with, for example, a string-input buffer as
defined in stringio.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="predefined">Predefined FileIO Devices</h2>

<p>The header defines the following set of predefined (and already opened)
devices:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
extern iftext fin;
extern oftext fout;
extern oftext ferr;
extern oftext fnull;
</pre>

<p>Device fin is attached to FILE* stdin, fout and ferr to stdout and stderr
respectively, and fnull is an output null device which simply absorbs output
silently. There is no null input device, but one can be created by constructing
an iftext with no arguments (i.e. using the void constructor).</p>

<p>Thus, to print to standard output:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
fout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>

<p>Remember that these connections mean that fout is buffered and ferr is
unbuffered.</p>

<p>To synchronise standard input and output, use the flush manipulator:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
string response;
fout &lt;&lt; "Name: " &lt;&lt; flush;
fin.getline(response);
</pre>

<p>This will print the string "Name: " and then flush the output buffer so that
it appears on the screen. The user can then give a response terminated in
return. The response is read in as a whole line by the getline() function.</p>
