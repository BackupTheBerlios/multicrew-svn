<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The STLplus library is intended to be portable between operating systems
and compilers. At present, this means Windows or Unix systems and gcc or
Microsoft compilers. Whether this will be extended to other operating systems
and compilers is a moot point, since the library requires a good
implementation of C++ templates.</p>

<p>In all cases you need to unpack the software into a directory which from
now on will be referred to as "the STLplus directory". This directory contains
the subdirectories "source", "docs" and "messages".</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="general">General Guidelines for Building STLplus</h2>

<p>The first and most important thing that you need to know about STLplus is
that it is just source code. There is no magic to it - all you need to do is
to compile the .cpp files with a compiler that is up to the job and the
library is ready to use.</p>

<p>Then, once the library is built, you can include any of the headers (or
just include stlplus.hpp to get everything) by putting the STLplus source
directory in your compiler's include path.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you link your application (or library), make sure the
object files created from compiling STLplus are linked into your
application.</p>

<p>To make life easier, bundle the compiled object files into an object
library (using the 'ar' command on Unix for example). Then you only have to
make sure the object library is linked into your application.</p>

<p>That is all. There really is nothing to it. The reason I keep hammering on about this
ease of use is that I've had nightmare scenes with other code libraries
which require mind-bogglingly complicated procedures to build and use them
(e.g. STLport and the Boost libraries - for all I know these are all superb,
but if I can't build them, how am I to find out?). So I want to let you know
that STLplus is not like this - it is trivially easy to build.</p>

<p>To simplify the building task, I have provided make files for the
platforms detailed in the rest of this document.</p>

<p>The STLplus library is designed to be built in either debug or release
variants. If you use the make utilities provided, these are set up with the
two variants already. However, if you want to do it yourself, here are
examples of the options to use. The examples are for the Gnu gcc compiler, but
the same principles can be applied to any other compiler.</p>

<pre class="script">
release build: gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -DNDEBUG -O3 -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
debug build:   gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -g           -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this description, the following are specific to the recommended way of
building STLplus:</p>

<dl>

<dt>-D&lt;platform&gt;</dt>

<dd>The name of the platform (i.e. operating system) that you are building on.
The word &lt;platform&gt; should be replaced by the actual platform, e.g.
-DLINUX or -DCYGWIN. This defines a macro which can then be used within the
code as a compiler directive to control platform-specific features. If this is
missing then you get a generic Unix build - which will be correct for any
Posix-compliant variant of Unix. A native Windows build should define _WIN32
(Note: the Visual Studio compiler and the Borland compiler do this for you, as
does the Gnu gcc compiler when run in Windows native mode (-mno-cygwin)). The required values for
these directives are listed on the page on <a href="porting.html">porting</a>.</dd>

<dt>-funsigned-char</dt>

<dd>
There is an ambiguity in C++ and C in that type <code>char</code> can be
either <code>unsigned</code> or <code>signed</code> and this is compiler and
platform dependent. I found that, if I build without specifying which
interpretation of <code>char</code> is to be used, most variants build okay.
However, I discovered that the native gcc build on Windows (known as the
Cygming configuration) has system libraries that are inconsistent with the
built-in default. Namely, the <code>getc</code> system call only works
correctly for <code>unsigned char</code> but the compiler default is
<code>signed char</code>. Therefore I have decided to force the signedness of
<code>char</code> to <code>unsigned</code> for all platforms.
</dd>

<dt>-DNDEBUG</dt>

<dd>In release builds, this removes debug code such as assertions, making the
code faster and smaller. It is the switch used by the ANSI C standard for the
assert() macro but is also used for the STLplus debug code.</dd>

<dt>-O3</dt>

<dd>In release builds, switch compiler optimisations on to get small, fast
code. In debug mode, optimisations should be switched off so the program has
all the original code present and can be stepped through in a debugger.</dd>

<dt>-g</dt>

<dd>In debug builds, the -g option includes symbolic information so that the
program can be run in a debugger. In release mode, omit this switch to make
the code harder to reverse engineer as well as a lot smaller and faster.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Again let me reiterate that these compiler switches are specific to the gcc
compiler used in this example. However, the <i>principles</i> explained here
should be used to build the library for any compiler. You just need to find
the correct compiler switches that will achieve these principles for your
compiler of choice.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> if you are building an application in <i>debug</i> mode, you
should link with a <i>debug</i> build of STLplus. Similarly, if you are
building an application in <i>release</i> mode, you should link with a
<i>release</i> build of STLplus. This is because both the application and
STLplus itself include the STLplus headers and there can be subtle differences
in implementation between release and debug builds.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="makefiles">Using my build system with Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>If you are using the Gnu gcc as your compiler, then I supply a set of make rules with STLplus
that will not only build this project but any other projects you are using too. In the STLplus
source directory is a Makefile. This is nearly empty. It contains the following:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The <code>makefiles</code> module is obtained from the same place that you got the STLplus
library. It needs to be downloaded separately. It contains the gcc.mak makefile rules which
automatically adjust to any project provided that it is organised in a certain way.</p>

<p>The STLplus Makefile assumes that the <code>makefiles</code> module is in the same parent
directory as the <code>stlplus</code> module. This is recommended, but if you wish to
use a different configuration, you will need to edit the include path in the Makefile to reflect
the change.</p>

<h3>Building with my Make System</h3>

<p>The gcc.mak makefile is a generic build system which provides a standard set of make rules for compiling
and linking any libraries and applications. It is not specific to STLplus. You
are free to use it as the build system for your own projects if you prefer.
It is designed to be as simple as
possible to use whilst allowing multi-library projects and different build
configurations - it currently supports a Debug build, a Release build and a
Gprof (code profiling) build. You do not have to use it of course - you can
write your own Makefile. However, you are strongly recommended to use the
standard makefiles not only to build STLplus, but also your own code.</p>

<p>To build the STLplus library, first start a command-line shell (either using the
shell for Unix using the <code>shell</code> command in
XEmacs). Then change directory to the stlplus source directory. Then simply
run one of the following commands:</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>Builds a debug library</dd>

<dt>make RELEASE=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a release library</dd>

<dt>make GPROF=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a code profiling library (using gprof)</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can build all three of these variants of the library without them
interfering since the object files
are stored in separate subdirectories for each build.</p>

<p>In all three cases the build creates an object library called libstlplus.a.
This is stored in a subdirectory which is build-specific. Again, refer to the <a href="porting.html">porting</a> page for the
Build Name column. As an example, the build for DEC Alpha running Linux has the Build Name
"LINUX-alpha". This then has an extra suffix added depending on the variant:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-debug</dt><dd>for the debug variant</dd>
<dt>-release</dt><dd>for the release variant</dd>
<dt>-gprof</dt><dd>for the gprof variant</dd>
</dl>

<p>So, for example, the debug variant of the DEC Alpha build will be stored in a subdirectory called
"LINUX-alpha-debug".</p>

<p>When you use my makefile system in a
multi-library project, the make system will automatically select the correct
version of libstlplus.a depending on the configuration chosen for the build.
For example, if you build an application using the DEC Alpha build, debug variant, the
build system will automatically link with LINUX-alpha-debug/libstlplus.a.</p>

<h3>Using with my Make System</h3>

<p>To use the STLplus library as part of another project, you need to create a
Makefile for that project that will make the stlplus headers available and
will link in the appropriate libstlplus.a file. The recommended way of doing
this is to use the standard gcc.mak makefile provided as part of the makefiles
module. Here is an example Makefile to build another object library from
source that includes the STLplus headers:</p>

<pre class="script">
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus/source
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This is stored in a file called Makefile in the source code directory of
the project.</p>

<p>The LIBRARIES variable is a space-separated list of libraries to include in
the project. It should point to the source code directory of each library. 
The gcc.mak makefile rules will build the current directory and
will add the LIBRARIES as extra include paths during compilation. Since this
Makefile only builds an object library, there is no link step.</p>

<p>When using this generic makefile, there are some rules to follow to make it
work.</p>

<ul>

<li>Library directories should have the same name as the library.</li>

<li>The library directory should have a subdirectory called source which
contains all of the source code plus the Makefile.</li>

<li>There should be no further sub-directories below the source directory.</li>

<li>All libraries in a project must have unique names.</li>

</ul>

<p>The current directory, i.e. the one containing the Makefile, is
always called source, so the directory above that, which has the name of the
project, is used as the name of the library.</li>

<p>To build a program rather than a library requires just one more line to be added to the Makefile.
Here is an example Makefile that builds a program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus/source
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The IMAGE variable tells the make system first that a program is being
built and second where the linked program should be placed. In this case there
is no path to the IMAGE so it will be built in the current directory. The name
of the program will be client (in fact, on Windoze, client.exe, but the .exe
extension should never be specified).</p>

<p>A common variant is to link all programs into a common "bin" directory at
the same level of directory as the library directories. This is two levels up
from the source directory:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus/source
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The overall directory structure is now:</p>

<ul>

<li type="circle">&lt;parent directory&gt;

<ul>

<li type="circle">bin
<ul>
<li type="square">client.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li type="circle">makefiles
<ul>
<li type="square">gcc.mak</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li type="circle">stlplus
<ul>
<li type="circle">source
<ul>
<li type="square">Makefile</li>
<li type="square">&lt;stlplus source files&gt;</li>
<li type="circle">CYGWIN-debug
<ul>
<li type="square">libstlplus.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li type="circle">docs</li>
<li type="circle">messages</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li type="circle">client
<ul>
<li type="circle">source
<ul>
<li type="square">Makefile</li>
<li type="square">&lt;client program source files&gt;</li>
<li type="circle">CYGWIN-debug
<ul>
<li type="square">libclient.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="no-makefiles">Using your own build system with Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>The previous section explained how to use my build system with the Gnu tools. However, you don't
have to use my build system at all for this since there are no special steps in building STLplus.</p>

<h3>Building Without my Make System</h3>

<p>Simply compile the source files with a .cpp extension using the following options:</p>

<pre class="script">
release build: gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -DNDEBUG -O3 -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
debug build:   gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -g           -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
</pre>

<p>The convention is to give the object file the same name as the source file
but with a .o extension. I prefer to put the object code in a target
subdirectory with a name that reflects the build - for example CYGWINrelease
indicates a Cygwin release build. This way you keep the object code for the
different builds separate.</p>

<p>It will make your life easier if you bundle the object files into a library:</p>

<pre class="script">
cd &lt;target dir&gt;
ar cr libstlplus.a &lt;object files&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Using Without my Make System</h3>

<p>For compilation, simply make sure that the directory containing the STLplus
source files is in your include path. For example:</p>

<pre class="script">
gcc -I$STLPLUS/source ...
</pre>

<p>This assumes that the environment variable STLPLUS points to the directory
containing the STLplus installation. You will have to define the variable with
the correct path if you want to do it this way. Alternatively, just give the full
path in the -I option.</p>

<p>For linking, you need to simply include the libstlplus.a library in the
link. For a debug build of your program, link with the debug build of the
STLplus library. For a release build, link with the release build of STLplus.
For example:</p>

<pre class="script">
ld ... $STLPLUS/source/&lt;target_dir&gt;/libstlplus.a ... -lstdc++
</pre>

<p>In this case, &lt;target_dir&gt; will be CYGWIN-debug for a debug build and
CYGWINrelease for a release build. The last part of this command (-lstdc++)
links in the STL library. You need this because STLplus is layered onto the
STL.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="cygwin">Unix-emulation build on Windoze using Cygwin and Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>You can build Unix command-line tools and libraries on Windows using the Gnu gcc
compiler if you first install the 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> system. This system is a
Unix-emulation layer which provides a Unix-like systems interface to the
Windows operating system. For example, you access the file system as if it was
a Unix file-system, create subprocesses using the Unix functions fork and exec, create pipes
using Unix pipe and so on. This is a great way of porting Unix utilities to
Windows, but has the disadvantage that you have to use Unix-like paths instead
of Windows-like paths. I use Cygwin to develop the Unix version of
STLplus whilst actually sitting at a Windows-based PC. For a native Windows
version, see the next section.</p>

<p>Cygwin provides a complete development environment including the gcc
compiler, the gdb debugger, make and all the usual Unix commands. Furthermore,
the <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a> project provides a Cygwin
build of XEmacs which acts as a fully integrated development environment.</p>

<p>You need to install Cygwin and, if you like it, XEmacs, before you can
build the Cygwin version of the STLplus library. Then simply follow the instructions in the previous
sections for building STLplus with Gnu tools.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="mingw">Native build on Windoze using Cygwin and Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>The Cygwin development environment introduced in the last section
also allows <i>native</i> Windows applications to be built using the Gnu compiler.
Unlike Unix-emulation builds, this does not use the Unix emulation layer and you therefore
access operating services through the Windows system calls directly.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> version 3.2 and later of gcc works very well in this mode. Prior
versions were incomplete and could only be made to build a native Windows
application with a bit of a bodge. If you want to produce native builds using
Cygwin, then if possible upgrade to at least v3.2 of gcc to make your life
easier. These instructions only apply to v3.2 and later.</p>

<p>You build native applications with the Cygwin gcc compiler by specifying a
special compiler switch (-mno-cygwin) for both compilation and linking. </p>

<p>The following settings are used
in addition to the standard rules for the Cygwin builds:</p>

<pre class="script">
compile   : same as Cygwin plus: -mno-cygwin
link      : same as Cygwin plus: -mno-cygwin
</pre>

<p>The standard Makefile system I supply can be switched into native
compilation mode when
compiling on Cygwin (and only then) by setting the environment variable CYGMING
to the value "on". This name is a reflection of the fact that the ability to
compile native Windows applications comes from a combination of the Cygwin
project and the Mingw project (Mingw standas for "minimum Gnu on Windows").
The CYGMING variable can be set in the command line to make:</p>

<pre class="script">
make CYGMING=on
</pre>

<p>This is a one-off setting. To make the setting more permanent, change the
environment of the shell you're running:</p>

<pre class="script">
export CYGMING=on
make
</pre>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="unix-other">Other Unix builds using Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>STLplus is designed to be portable to any Unix system, well at least any
Posix-compliant Unix system, but this is only
true when using the Gnu gcc compiler. Native compilers on the various flavours
of Unix are not supported. This is not a realistic goal when there are so many
variations between compilers.</p>

<p>On Linux, the native compiler is Gnu's gcc so there is not a problem. On
other platforms, you will need to install Gnu gcc and the associated Gnu tools
such as gdb and the linker.</p>

<h3>Using Without my Make System</h3>

<p>Once the Gnu tools are installed, the building and using instructions are
basically the same as for the Cygwin Unix-emulation build.</p>

<h3>Using With my Make System</h3>

<p>The only problem you may have is that your version of Unix is not recognised
by the default makefile gcc.mak. In that case, you can easily add support for
your platform. The key is the first executable code in the gcc.mak file:</p>

<pre class="script">
OS     := $(shell uname -s)

ifneq ($(findstring CYGWIN,$(OS)),)
...
</pre>

<p>This executes the 'uname' system command and then tries to identify the
operating system by recognising a substring of the return value. This is then
used to set PLATFORM to a simplified name for that platform. For example, the
current version of Cygwin that I'm using has a uname of "CYGWIN_NT-5.0". The
basic version shown above only recognises the Cygwin build and sets PLATFORM
to be the simplified form "CYGWIN". In general, the PLATFORM value should be a
short representation of the operating system name in uppercase. Different
names should be used for versions of the operating system that use different
object code and are not binary compatible. Binary compatible versions of an
operating system should be mapped onto the same short name. Thus, support for
Linux can be easily added:</p>

<pre class="script">
# Build on Linux
ifneq ($(findstring Linux,$(UNAME)),)
PLATFORM  := LINUX
endif
</pre>

<p>In fact, support for Linux and Solaris has already been added in this way.
Further platforms will be added as I try them.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM name is used as the prefix to the subdirectory used to store
object code. Thus the Cygwin debug build is stored in CYGWIN-debug whilst the
Linux debug build is stored in LINUXdebug. This organisation means that the
same disk can be mounted on different operating systems and built without the
different operating systems conflicting with each other. It also keeps the
different kinds of build (e.g. release or debug) in separate directories.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM value is also passed to the compiler as a macro definition in
the form -D&lt;platform&gt;, where &lt;platform&gt; is the name of the platform (e.g. -DLINUX). This
means that if it proves necessary to differentiate between platforms to get
any part of the C++ code working, then this is done by adding "#ifdef LINUX" or
whatever compiler switches to the code. The macro _WIN32 is defined for native
Windows builds regardless of the compiler - if this is not set then the
default is to assume a vanilla Unix build. To date, only very minor
differences have been found between different Unix platforms.
However, if you use a different
build system it is a good idea to pass this parameter to the compiler (e.g.
-DLINUX) in case future updates to the library do need to have these switches.
Check the ../../makefiles/gcc.mak file for the values currently supported, even if you don't
plan to use my make system.</p>

<p>One final trick worth noting if you are using my build system - the IMAGE variable can be used to put
different operating system programs into different subdirectories by using the
PLATFORM variable. For example, here's a variant on the Makefile shown earlier
for the client program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/${PLATFORM}/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus/source
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This will put Cygwin binaries in ../../bin/CYGWIN and Linux binaries into
../../bin/LINUX.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the IMAGE variable can put each different build into a
different subdirectory by using the SUBDIR variable instead of PLATFORM. The
SUBDIR variable includes a prefix for the platform and the suffix for the
different build configuration, so the debug build will be called CYGWIN-debug
for the Cygwin build and LINUX-debug for the Linux build.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="microsoft">Micro$oft Visual Studio</h2>

<p>The STLplus can alternatively be built on Windows using the native Microsoft Visual Studio
compiler. The STLplus library appears as a project under Visual Studio. Beware that
there is a terminology problem here - Microsoft call a library a project and a
project a workspace, and so on. I will try to remember to use Microsoft
terminology here.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>The STLplus library comes with a Visual Studio project file (<code>stlplus.dsp</code>) which is
kept in the <code>source</code> directory. To add the STLplus project to an existing workspace, select the menu item
Project->Insert&nbsp;Project&nbsp;into&nbsp;Workspace... and then navigate into
the <code>stlplus</code> directory and into the <code>source</code> subdirectory. There you will find
the project file <code>stlplus.dsp</code>. Select this file and click OK. The stlplus
project will be added to your workspace.</p>

<p>The project can now be built. First make stlplus the current project by
selecting menu item Project->Set&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Project->stlplus. Then
select the configuration you wish to build. You can build all of them one at a
time or even use the batch build, but I'll explain the simplest way. Select
Build->Set&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Configuration and a dialog will display all the
project/configuration combinations. The Debug configuration is for use in
debug builds, the Release is for use in release builds (no debug information).
Select a
configuration and click OK. Finally, build the library by selecting
Build->Build&nbsp;stlplus.lib. At this stage, if you wish, you can select
other configurations and build them too. Each configuration is stored
separately so they do not overwrite each other.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the supplied project file will build STLplus so that it uses
the multi-threaded versions of the C runtime library (msvcrt.dll). The default
for a new project however is to use the single-threaded versions. You will
need to adjust the project settings, either for STLplus or for your
application so that all projects use the same settings. Sadly, this is a
side-effect of Microsoft's poor design for Visual Studio which means that
workspace settings seem to be saved in project files. They leave it to the
user to resolve the problems this causes. The symptom that will tell you that
you have this problem is that, when you link the application, every symbol in
the C runtime library will result in an error message from the linker saying
that it is multiply defined.</p>

<h3>Using</h3>

<p>To use any of the STLplus headers, you need to set up an include path for
the C++ compiler and you need to set up a project dependency for the
linker.</p>

<p>To set up the include path, select the project that you
wish to have access to the stlplus project. Then select the menu item
Project->Settings. A mind-bogglingly complicated dialog will pop up. Select
the configuration popup menu in the top left and choose
All&nbsp;Configurations. Then select the C++ tab from the set of tabs at the
top of the right-hand pane. Then select
the Category popup menu just below the tabs and select Preprocessor. This has
a text field called Additional&nbsp;include&nbsp;directories. Type in the path
to the stlplus source subdirectory where all the headers are found. You have
to type this because Microsoft didn't think to give you a directory selection
dialog to help you here. Click OK to dismiss the mind-boggling dialog.</p>

<p>To set up the linker dependency, make sure the project you wish to use
stlplus is still selected in the right-hand project pane. Then, select the
menu item Project->Dependencies. The project you wish to set up dependencies
for will be selected in the popup menu at the top and the other projects,
including stlplus, will be listed in the list entry below that. Click on
stlplus so that a tick appears. This makes the selected project depend on
stlplus and therefore will cause any program built with the selected project
link with the stlplus project. Click on OK to dismiss the dependencies
dialog.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> you should only set up a dependency on an application project,
not on a project that just creates a library. Sadly, Microsoft think a
dependency on a library file should be resolved by copying the contents of the
STLplus library file into the other library file, giving you two copies of the
object code. This will subsequently cause a link error. The symptom is that
the functions from STLplus will be reported as multiply defined.</p>

<p>To test the configuration, try including an STLplus header in your code and
calling a function (or creating a class) from the library. You should be able
to compile and link the project successfully.</p>

<p>The most common error is to get the include path wrong or to forget to set
the include path for all configurations. This can be detected by the compiler
giving an error on a #include line in your code that includes the STLplus
header. If this happens, redo the include path step above.</p>

<p>The second most
common error is to simply forget to set up the linker dependency, since this
does not prevent compilation from working. This will manifest itself by a
series of linker errors due to missing symbols. If this happens, repeat the
linker dependency step above.</p>

<p>The final common error is to have different projects with different
run-time library selections. This manifests itself by linker errors whereby
standard library functions are multiply defined in different libraries. To fix
this, select the menu item Project->Settings and select a specific
Configuration (you cannot do this for All&nbsp;Configurations. For example,
select the Debug configuration. Then select the C++ tab at the top right and
then select the popup menu immediately below the tag, choosing the
Code&nbsp;Generation option. There are four popup menus here and the top right
of them is labelled Use&nbsp;Run-time&nbsp;Library. This should be the same
for all projects - check this by clicking on different projects in the left
hand pane whilst watching the contents of the run-time library popup. If there
are inconsistencies, correct them. For a debug build, always pick a debug
library, but you can then choose whether it is a single-threaded static
library, a multi-threaded static library or a multi-threaded DLL. Choose the
same for all projects. Then change the configuration to Release and check them
too. This time, choose the non-debug versions of the run-time library. When
you are happy that you have consistency, click OK to dismiss the dialog and
try building again.</p>

<p>In the default project file supplied with STLplus, the Debug configuration
links with the Debug Multi-Threaded DLL and the Release configuration links with
the Multi-Threaded DLL. You can either adopt the same conventions or
change your copy of the stlplus project file.</p>
