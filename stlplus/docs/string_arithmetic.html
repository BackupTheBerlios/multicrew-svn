<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a family of functions that interpret the contents of a std::string
as a binary number and perform arithmetic on it.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>

<p>There are two interpretations of the binary string supported - signed and
unsigned.</p>

<p>The left-most bit is the most-significant bit.</p>

<p>The left-most bit is index 0. This is because of the way that C++
interprets string constants such as "0111". In this case, the character '0' is
in index position 0, the '1's are in positions 1,2 and 3 respectively. In
order to be able to write and interpret strings easily, this convention has
been adopted even though it is contrary to the normal hardware convention
where the right-most bit is index 0.</p>

<p>You cannot mix types - to add a signed and an unsigned, you must convert
one of the values to the type of the other. This is typically done by resizing
the unsigned value one bit larger so that there is now a sign bit and then
using the resulting string as a signed value.</p>

<p>There are no new types used in this package - all arithmetic is performed
on just std::string. Therefore, there cannot be any operators or operator
overloading. Instead, descriptive function names are used to clarify what
operation is being performed and what interpretation is being made of the
string contents.</p>

<p>Many functions have an argument that allows the result size to be
specified. The default value is 0. This does not mean make a zero-sized
result, it means make the result the minimum size required to represent the
value. For example unsigned_add("00001","00001") will return "10" because this
is the minimum size required to represent 2 as an unsigned number.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>At present there is no support for any character values in the
string except 0 or 1. In particular, there's no support for X or Z values.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="unsigned">Unsigned Operations</h2>

<p>In unsigned arithmetic, the characters of the string are interpretaed as a
magnitude with no sign bit. Thus the string "1111" is interpreted as the value
15.</p>

<a name="unsigned_resize"><h3>Size Changers</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string unsigned_resize(const std::string&amp; argument, unsigned size = 0);
</pre>

<p>Returns a new string that is the same as the input string but with leading
bits either added or discarded to make it the requested size. If the value is
too big for the target size, then the value will necessarily change. Otherwise
it is value-preserving (translation: I add leading 0s because it is an
unsigned number).</p>

<a name="unsigned_comparison"><h3>Comparisons</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
bool unsigned_equality(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool unsigned_inequality(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool unsigned_less_than(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool unsigned_less_than_or_equal(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool unsigned_greater_than(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool unsigned_greater_than_or_equal(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
</pre>

<p>These are numeric comparisons based on the unsigned interpretation of the
value and independent of the string sizes. Thus, for example "000000000000001"
is less than "10".</p>

<a name="unsigned_arithmetic"><h3>Arithmetic</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string unsigned_add(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_subtract(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_multiply(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_exponent(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_divide(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_modulus(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_remainder(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
</pre>

<p>Not bad eh? A complete set of arithmetic operations are provided for
unsigned strings. In all cases, the target size of 0 means return the minimum
sized result necessary to represent the result value.</p>

<p>Beware that subtraction of a large number from a small one does not give a
negative result because this is unsigned arithmetic - instead it will
underflow and give a positive result. There's no way of detecting this
underflow apart from testing beforehand which value is the larger using the
comparison functions above.</p>

<p>The concept of modulus and remainder are taken from VHDL - one of the few
things they got right. In fact for unsigned arithmetic they are the same, so
I'll defer an explanation until the signed version...</p>

<p>By the way, multiply is defined in terms of add and exponent is defined in
terms of multiply, so don't expect miraculous performance.</p>

<a name="unsigned_logic"><h3>Logic</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string unsigned_not(const std::string&amp; argument, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_and(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_nand(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_or(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_nor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_xor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_xnor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, unsigned size = 0);
</pre>

<p>The only unary logic operator is the not operator. This resizes the result
to the target size first, then does the not operation on it and returns the
result without further resizing, even if there are now leading 0s. If the
target size is 0, then the result is the same size as the input. Thus, for example
unsigned_not("10",4) gives "1101" (it resizes first to "0010" and then inverts
each bit).</p>

<p>The binary logic operators are similar in that the arguments are
resized to the target size before the logic operation and the result returned
that size. If the target size is 0 then the target size is the same as the
longest argument.</p>

<a name="unsigned_shift"><h3>Shifts</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string unsigned_shift_left(const std::string&amp; argument, unsigned shift, unsigned size = 0);
std::string unsigned_shift_right(const std::string&amp; argument, unsigned shift, unsigned size = 0);
</pre>

<p>The shift operations perform arithmetic shifts, in this case of course
unsigned. The left shift appends os to the string, whilst the right shift
discards the lsbs. Finally, the result is resized to the target size - or the
minimum size if the target size is 0.</p>

<a name="unsigned_conversions"><h3>Integer Conversions</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned long unsigned_to_ulong(const std::string&amp; argument);
std::string ulong_to_unsigned(unsigned long argument, unsigned size = 0);
</pre>

<p>Of course it is useful to be able to convert to/from C++ integer types and
this is what these two functions do. I've used unsigned long as the integer
type because this is the largest unsigned type supported by all compilers. One
day all compilers will support the long long extension, but in the meantime
conversions are limited to this 32-bit (usually) type.</p>

<p>If you try to convert
to the integer type using to_ulong and the value is too big to fit, it just
wraps round silently. Put another way, leading bits are discarded and this may
result in a changed value.</p>

<p>The conversion from the integer type to a string returns a string of the
requested size even if that changes the value. However, a target size of 0 as
usual gives a result of the minimum size necessary to represent the result
correctly.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="signed">Signed Operations</h2>

<p>In signed arithmetic, the characters of the string are interpreted as a
2's-complement representation. Thus the string "1111" is interpreted as the value
-7.</p>

<a name="signed_resize"><h3>Size Changers</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string signed_resize(const std::string&amp; argument, signed size = 0);
</pre>

<p>Returns a new string that is the same as the input string but with leading
sign bits either added or discarded to make it the requested size. If the value is
too big for the target size, then the value will necessarily change. Otherwise
it is value-preserving (translation: I sign extend because it is a
signed number).</p>

<a name="signed_tests"><h3>Range Tests</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
bool is_negative(const std::string&amp; argument);
bool is_natural(const std::string&amp; argument);
bool is_positive(const std::string&amp; argument);
bool is_zero(const std::string&amp; argument);
</pre>

<p>These tests only exist for signed numbers because they have no meaning for
unsigned numbers. The exception is the is_zero test which applies equally will
to either number representation. A natural is the range 0..infinity, whilst
positive excludes 0 to give the range 1..infinity. Negative is the range
-1..-infinity.</p>

<a name="signed_comparison"><h3>Comparisons</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
bool signed_equality(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool signed_inequality(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool signed_less_than(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool signed_less_than_or_equal(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool signed_greater_than(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
bool signed_greater_than_or_equal(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right);
</pre>

<p>These are numeric comparisons based on the signed interpretation of the
value and independent of the string sizes. Thus, for example "000000000000001"
is less than "10".</p>

<a name="signed_arithmetic"><h3>Arithmetic</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string signed_add(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_subtract(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_multiply(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_exponent(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_divide(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_modulus(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_remainder(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
</pre>

<p>In all cases, the target size of 0 means return the minimum
sized result necessary to represent the result value.</p>

<p>The concept of modulus and remainder are taken from VHDL - one of the few
things they got right. Modulo arithmetic gives a result in the range
0..(right-1), so for example anything modulo 8 is guaranteed to give a natural
result in the range 0..7. Remainder is the remainder after division and can be
either sign. For example, the remainder of -15/4 is -3 whereas the remainder
of 15/4 is 3. Thus the remainder falls in the range -(right-1)..(right-1)

<p>By the way, as with unsigned numbers, multiply is defined in terms of add
and exponent is defined in terms of multiply, so don't expect miraculous
performance.</p>

<a name="signed_logic"><h3>Logic</h3></a>

std::string signed_or(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_nor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_xor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
std::string signed_xnor(const std::string&amp; left, const std::string&amp; right, signed size = 0);
</pre>

<p>The only unary logic operator is the not operator. This resizes the result
to the target size first, then does the not operation on it and returns the
result without further resizing, even if there are now leading excess sign bits. If the
target size is 0, then the result is the same size as the input. Thus, for example
signed_not("10",4) gives "1101" (it resizes first to "0010" and then inverts
each bit).</p>

std::string signed_shift_right(const std::string&amp; argument, signed shift, signed size = 0);
</pre>

<p>The shift operations perform arithmetic shifts, in this case of course
signed. The left shift appends 0s to the string, giving a longer result but
not discarding any sign bits, whilst the right shift
discards the lsbs. Finally, the result is resized to the target size - or the
minimum size if the target size is 0.</p>

<a name="signed_conversions"><h3>Integer Conversions</h3></a>

<pre class="cpp">
long signed_to_long(const std::string&amp; argument);
std::string long_to_signed(long argument, unsigned size = 0);
