<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This package provides a tidy interface to the OS-specific operation of
spawning a subprocess with optional pipes connecting the child's standard input,
output and error streams to the parent process. Just about every possible use of
subprocesses is covered by these classes.</p>

<p>There are two major motivations for having this set of classes:</p>

<ol>

<li>Creating processes is error prone and difficult. Creating communications
channels through pipes is also error prone and difficult. Doing both could cost
you weeks of development time for no productive result. The knowledge built up
over years (well, several weeks at least) of developing multi-processing
programs is encapsulated in these classes which provide a very easy to use
interface.</li>

<li>Subprocess handling is radically different on Unix and on Windows. These
classes provide a completely abstract and platform-independent interface so
using these classes ensures inherent portability of your program.</li>

</ol>

<p>Subprocesses are represented by objects of a subprocess class. This follows
the C++ convention of containment, such that all recoverable resources are
encapsulated in a class so that, for example, if an exception is thrown, the
object destructor is called. In the case of the subprocess classes, the
destructor kills the subprocess, thus recovering all resources associated with
it.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of subprocess supported, each represented by a
different class. These are the synchronous and asynchronous subprocess:</p>

<dl>

<dt>synchronous subprocess</dt>

<dd>
<p>This is a subprocess which runs to completion before returning control to the
parent process. In other words, you call a function to start the subprocess
running and the function will not return until the subprocess has finished. This
is the most common requirement for command-line tools. The synchronous process
is made more useful by allowing one callback function to be run in the parent
process during child execution. This callback function is typically used to
write to the child's standard input and/or read from the child's standard output
or (more rarely) the standard error. Synchronous subprocesses support blocking
I/O to and from the child process.</p>
</dd>

<dt>asynchronous subprocess</dt>

<dd>
<p>This is a subprocess which runs in the background whilst the parent program
can carry on doing other work. It is not a detached process though - you do have
to keep checking on the status of the child process and you have to make sure
the child is closed down correctly when it completes. This is probably the most
common requirement for GUI tools. Asynchronous subprocesses support non-blocking
I/O to and from the child process.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>In both cases the standard input, output and error streams can either be left
connected to the console or can be redirected through pipes to the parent
process where they can be used by the parent program to communicate with the
child. Each of the three streams can be redirected separately.</p>

<p>A common use of redirection is similar to the "backtick" operation used in
Unix shells. This is where a command is run and its standard output captured and
returned as a string. This common requirement is provided by a special backtick
subprocess class which is derived from the synchronous subprocess class.</p>

<p>In addition to the subprocess classes, this package provides a complete set
of utility functions for performing creating and manipulating
the argument and environment vectors typically used when using subprocesses.
Furthermore, platform-independent path lookup functions are provided in
<a href="file_system.html#paths">file_system.hpp</a></p>

<p>When creating subprocesses, there are a number of different behaviours
required. For example, sometimes you want to perform path lookup on a command
just like the shells do it. Other times you do not need path
lookup. Furthermore, subprocesses require the command to be executed to be
expressed as an argument vector (like the argv parameter passed to main), not as
a string. Also, you may wish to change the environment of the subprocess to
modify its behaviour compared with the parent process. Most of the time, you
just want the subprocess to inherit the same environment being used by the
parent process.</p>

<p>This package provides a set of functions and classes that allows the full set
of permutations to be achieved when using the subprocess classes.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="arguments">Argument Vectors</h2>

<p>An argument vector is represented as a fixed C array of char*. This makes it
difficult to manipulate, since you need to guess how big to make the array. Such
guesswork is always bad practice since if you underestimate the size, the result
is memory corruption and if you overkill, the result is large memory overhead
with no benefit. To overcome this limitation, it makes sense to encapsulate the
problem as a class that manages the argument vector and automatically resizes as
necessary.</p>

<p>The class arg_vector does exactly this. It is a class that not only
manipulates argument vectors, but also allows the conversion to and from command
lines, including the typical argument quoting required by these
conversions. Furthermore, the conversion to and from command-lines is
operating-system specific. On Unix, the command will be treated in a
Bourne-shell compatible way. On Windows it will be treated in a DOS-shell
compatible way.</p>

<p>The class interface is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class arg_vector
{
public:
  arg_vector (void);
  arg_vector (const arg_vector&amp;);
  arg_vector (char**);
  arg_vector (const std::string&amp;);
  arg_vector (const char*);

  ~arg_vector (void);

  arg_vector&amp; operator = (const arg_vector&amp;);
  arg_vector&amp; operator = (char**);
  arg_vector&amp; operator = (const std::string&amp;);
  arg_vector&amp; operator = (const char*);

  arg_vector&amp; operator += (const std::string&amp;);
  void insert (unsigned index, const std::string&amp;);
  void clear (unsigned index);
  void clear (void);

  operator char** (void) const;
  char** argv (void) const;
  unsigned size (void) const;
  char* operator [] (unsigned index) const;
  char* argv0 (void) const;

  std::string image (void) const;
  friend otext&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (otext&amp;, const arg_vector&amp;);
};
</pre>

<p>There are five constructors representing the likely behaviours required
when building an arg_vector object:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arg_vector(void);
</pre>

<p>This constructor creates an empty arg_vector object which can be built up in
stages later using the += operator.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arg_vector (const arg_vector&amp;);
</pre>

<p>This constructor copies the arg_vector object (yes it is a copy).</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arg_vector (char** argv);
</pre>

<p>This constructor converts from the char* argv[] format as used for example in
the parameters to main() to the arg_vector object by copying the strings.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arg_vector (const std::string&amp;);
arg_vector (const char*);
</pre>

<p>These constructors convert the command string into an arg_vector object. In the
process it performs unquoting of arguments that are quoted, using standard
Bourne shell rules on Unix and DOS-shell rules on Windows.</p>

<p>There are also assignment operations which allow the same constructions on a
pre-existing arg_vector object. These assignments clear the object, then build it
using the same type-dependent rules as the constructors.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arg_vector&amp; operator += (const std::string&amp;);
void insert (unsigned index, const std::string&amp;);
void clear (unsigned index);
void clear (void);
</pre>

<p>These functions allow the manipulation of an arg_vector by adding and
removing arguments. The += operator simply appends an extra argument to the
arg_vector object. No string processing or unquoting is done on the string, it
is simply added by copying. Insert is a generalised form of this which allows an
argument to be inserted anywhere. The clear function either clear one argument
at a given index or clear the whole arg_vector. Bear in mind when constructing
an arg_vector that argument 0 is the command name and subsequent arguments are
its parameters.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
operator char** (void) const;
char** argv (void) const;
unsigned size (void) const;
char* operator [] (unsigned index) const;
char* argv0 (void) const;
</pre>

<p>These are five access functions which allow the arg_vector object to be
examined. Of particular use is the argv0() function, which gives simple access
to the first argument which is the command name. This could then be passed to
the path_lookup() function for PATH lookup or simply passed as the first
parameter to the subprocess fork function.</p>

<p>The operator char** is the type-cast operator that allows the arg_vector
class to be used as a parameter to any function that takes an argument vector as
an argument simply by type-casting it to (char**). Returns a pointer to the
internal data structure so this must not be deleted. The argv() function has the
same functionality but using a member function call rather than a type
conversion. This form is preferred nowadays since it is more explicit.</p>

<p>The operator[] is the index operator which allows each argument to be
examined individually. The argument vector is null terminated, so you can index
up to one item past the end of the arg_vector and test the return value being
null to exit the loop. Alternatively you can use the size() function to find how
many arguments are in the vector. The char* returned is a pointer to the
internal data structure so this must not be deleted.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string image (void) const;
friend otext&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (otext&amp;, const arg_vector&amp;);
</pre>

<p>The image() function converts the argument vector into a string
representation that could be used as a command line or just to print out the
command about to be executed. The function performs quoting of dodgy arg_vector
in an operating system dependent way, so the resultant command will be
compatible with Bourne shell on Unix and DOS shell on Windows.</p>

<p>Finally, to complete the set, there is a TextIO output operator for printing
out the arg_vector class, for example in debug diagnostics.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="environment">Environment Control</h2>

<p>The environment is manipulated using a similar vector structure to argument
vectors. However, extra functionality is required to find and manipulate
individual variables, since each variable is represented as variable=value all
as one entry in the vector. Class env_vector is similar to class arg_vector but
has this extra functionality.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the env_vector has a different data structure on Unix (where it
is a char**) and on Windows (where it is a char*). This difference is handled
implicitly by the class, so you can write portable code without having to know
the difference.</p>

<p>The interface is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class env_vector
{
public:
  env_vector (void);
  env_vector (const env_vector&amp;);
  ~env_vector (void);

  env_vector&amp; operator = (const env_vector&amp;);

  void clear (void);
  void add (const std::string&amp; name, const std::string&amp; value);
  bool remove (const std::string&amp; name);

  std::string operator [] (const std::string&amp; name) const;
  std::string get (const std::string&amp; name) const;

  unsigned size (void) const;
  std::pair&lt;std::string,std::string&gt; operator [] (unsigned index) const;
  std::pair&lt;std::string,std::string&gt; get (unsigned index) const;

  ENVIRON_TYPE envp (void) const;

  friend otext&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (otext&amp;, const env_vector&amp;);
};
</pre>

<p>The void constructor in fact initialises the env_vector object from the
current process, so this gives the expected behaviour when using subprocesses,
giving the equivalent of the default rules (where child processes inherit from
their parent). This also provides an easy way to access the current processes's
env_vector in an operating-system independent way. The copy construictor and the
assignment operator do make copies of the env_vector.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void add (const std::string&amp; name, const std::string&amp; value);
bool remove (const std::string&amp; name);
void clear (void);
</pre>

<p>The env_vector is manipulated through the add and remove functions. The add
function adds a variable as a name=value pair, whilst the remove function
removes a variable from the environment, returning true if it existed. The clear
function is unlikely to be used, but if it is, it removes all the variables.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string operator [] (const std::string&amp; name) const;
std::string get (const std::string&amp; name) const;

unsigned size (void) const;
std::pair&lt;std::string,std::string&gt; operator [] (unsigned index) const;
std::pair&lt;std::string,std::string&gt; get (unsigned index) const;
</pre>

<p>The value of a variable can be found using the first get
function or the index operator[] which takes the variable name as an
argument. For example, to find the PATH, use:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
env_vector env;
string path = env["PATH"];
</pre>

<p>Variables are case-sensitive on Unix but case-insensitive on Windoze.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the variables can bne accessed by index. The size() function
gives the number of variables and the get and operator[] functions with an
unsigned argument allow access by index. Note that these return the result as an
STL pair.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ENVIRON_TYPE envp (void) const;
</pre>

<p>This function gets the env_vector values in the class in the
operating-system specific form expected by the subprocess classes. It is only
really used within the subprocess classes since you are unlikely to use the raw
data yourself. ENVIRON_TYPE is char** on Unix and char* on Windoze.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="synchronous">Synchronous Subprocesses</h2>

<p>Synchronous subprocesses are created using the subprocess class. The
interface to this class is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class subprocess
{
public:
  subprocess(void);
  virtual ~subprocess(void);

  void add_variable(const std::string&amp; name, const std::string&amp; value);
  bool remove_variable(const std::string&amp; name);

  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; path, const arg_vector&amp; argv,
             bool connect_stdin = false, bool connect_stdout = false, bool connect_stderr = false);
  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; command_line,
             bool connect_stdin = false, bool connect_stdout = false, bool connect_stderr = false);

  virtual bool callback(void);
  bool kill(void);

  int write_stdin(std::string&amp; buffer);
  int read_stdout(std::string&amp; buffer);
  int read_stderr(std::string&amp; buffer);

  void close_stdin(void);
  void close_stdout(void);
  void close_stderr(void);

  bool error(void) const;
  std::string error_text(void) const;

  int exit_status(void) const;
};
</pre>

<p>The constructor does nothing but initialise the internal data structures. The
actual spawn operation is deferred until the spawn() function is called.</p>

<p>Prior to calling spawn(), the set of environment variables to be used by the
child can be modified using the add_variable() and remove_variable()
functions. The initial set of variables are the same as are present in the
parent process.</p>

<p>The spawn() functions actually create and run the subprocess. They do not
return until the subprocess has completed (this is a synchronous
subprocess). The return value of the spawn function is true if the spawn
succeeded and false if it failed.</p>

<p>The first form of the spawn() function takes two main arguments - the command
and an argument vector. This is the most flexible option since it gives more
control over the running of the subprocess. Bear in mind that an arg_vector is a
platform-independent form.</p>

<p>The command should be the name of the program to run. No path lookup is
performed so this must be a full path unless the program happens to be in the
current directory. This is the case if you have created a temporary script file,
but is generally not the case. To perform path lookup, use the path_lookup
function. If you already know the path for some reason, just use that path
directly, but make sure it is platform independent (for example, form the string
using the platform-independent interface provided by <a
href="file_system.html">file_system.hpp</a>.</p>

<p>The argv argument is the command name and its arguments in an arg_vector object.</p>

<p>In addition to these main arguments, there are three switches which control
which of the standard streams are to be connected by pipes between the current
subprocess object (known as the parent) and the subprocess (known as the
child). If you specify, for example, that connect_stdin is true, then the
standard input of the child will be connected to the parent object by a pipe
which can be written to from the parent. If a switch is false, then the relevant
standard stream will be connected to the terminal.</p>

<p>The second form of spawn() is similar, but instead of the separate main
arguments, it takes a command line as a single string. This command line is
executed just as if it was running in a shell. Path lookup is carried out to
find the program to run and the program is run with the default env_vector,
which is the same env_vector as the parent process.</p>

<p>In both cases, if the spawn of the subprocess is successful, the spawn()
function will call the parent callback() member function, wait for it to
complete, wait for the child to finish, then return.</p>

<p>The callback() function is made virtual because this is used to customise the
subprocess class. The default callback() function just closes all the pipes and
returns. You can modify this behaviour by creating a derivative class with a
different callback() function. This is the only function you have to provide
(although you may need to also provide a destructor if there is any closing down
to be done).</p>

<p>For example, if you wish to read the text coming from the child process's
stdout stream, you would write a callback() function to do this. The
backtick_subprocess is in fact a predefined derivative which does exactly that
and will be described later.</p>

<p>Within the callback() function, the streams are manipulated using the
provided functions. For example, to read from the standard output, use the
read_stdout function. These functions are written in a platform-independent
way so that you do not need to know the different implementations of pipes used
on different operating systems.</p>

<p>The write_stdin function takes a single argument, a buffer string. The buffer
contains the text to be written. When text is written, the text is removed from
the string to show this.</p>

<p>The return value of the write_stdin is the number of characters written. If
this is less than the total length of the buffer, then the pipe has filled and
you should try writing the remainder later. Note that you may need to clear the
output and error pipes first. In fact, if you are writing that much text you
should consider using the asynchronous subprocesses instead since they are more
suited to interleaved input and output.</p>

<p>When you have finished writing to standard input, you should signal to the
child that you have finished by closing the standard input pipe with
close_stdin. This is the normal convention when using pipes to indicate to
the child process that there is no more text to process and that the child can
finish as soon as it has processed all of its input.</p>

<p>The read functions also take one argument - a buffer string to receive the
text. The read should be called repeatedly to get the text from the child until
the read function returns -1 indicating the end of the text. The callback()
function should then return. To close the pipes, call one of the close
functions. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> it is not necessary to close the output and error
pipes yourself, just return from the parent function and the fork function will
close them. You only need to close the input pipe to signal that the child is to
exit.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The read functions return -1 to indicate no more
text. This may be due to end-of-file being detected or an error on the
pipe. Test the error() function to see which has occurred.</p>

<p>The return value of the callback() function can be used to control child
termination. If your version of callback() returns true, the child will be
allowed to run to completion and the spawn() function will not return until that
has happened. If your callback() function returns false, however, the spawn
function will kill the child process immediately and then return.</p>

<p>The subprocess class keeps a record of any errors that happen during the
execution of the child subprocess. You can test for the existenc of an error
using the error() function, which returns true if there is an error. Some useful
diagnostic text for printing out to the user can be obtained from the
error_text() function.</p>

<p>Similarly, the exit status of the child process can be recovered using the
exit_status() function. Typically, a status of 0 indicates successful completion
and non-zero values indicate some kind of error. This is an error in the program
running as a child, whereas the error() described above relates to errors in the
parent whilst trying to run the child.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="backtick">Backtick Subprocesses</h2>

<p>There is a special derivative of the subprocess class called
backtick_subprocess. This is so-called because it is roughly equivalent to the
Unix shell backtick operator. For example, in Unix shells, you can run a
subprocess, capture its output and return this as a string like this:</p>

<pre class="script">
current_directory=`pwd`
</pre>

<p>This executes the pwd command, captures its output as a string and assigns
the value to the variable current_directory.</p>

<p>This is a very useful operation and so the backtick_subprocess is probably
the most useful subprocess class.</p>

<p>The interface to the backtick_subprocess is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class backtick_subprocess : public subprocess
{
public:
  backtick_subprocess(void);
  virtual bool callback(void);
  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; path, const arg_vector&amp; argv);
  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; command_line);
  const std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&amp; text(void) const;
  std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&amp; text(void);
};
</pre>

<p>This has slightly modified spawn functions, since the user has no control
over which pipes are connected - the standard output of the child is
automatically connected to the parent and the other two pipes are left
disconnected. Apart from this they are the same as the subprocess spawn
commands. The only thing you need to know about this class is that when the
spawn function returns, the text field in the class contains the output text of
the child process and the error function will give error status. Note that the
return value of the fork function is still significant - it is false if the
spawn failed, true if the command run successfully. The text field is only valid
if the fork returns true.</p>

<p>Note: only the standard output is captured, just as with the shell
equivalent. If you wish to capture the standard error, write the command so that
it redirects standard error to standard output. Alternatively, if you want to
write a function that reads both output and error pipes, you should use
asynchronous subprocesses (see later) since they implement non-blocking reads on
these two pipes, thus allowing them to be interleaved.</p>

<p>The text field is a vector&lt;string&gt; so the line-breaks in the output are
preserved. The text field contains one string for every line of output received
from the child process.</p>

<p>To make life even easier, there are pre-packaged forms of the
backtick_subprocess class in functions called backtick:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; backtick(const std::string&amp; path, const arg_vector&amp; argv);
std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; backtick(const std::string&amp; command_line);
</pre>

<p>These create a backtick_subprocess, run the spawn function, collect the
output and return the result, all in one function call. The only disadvantage of
this functional form is there is no return value to test for success and no way
to get any error messages. If the command fails, the return value will be
empty. However, it will also be empty if the command didn't produce any output
and you cannot tell the difference between these two outcomes. However, for
commands which you definitely know produce output, the empty array is a safe
test for failure.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="asynchronous">Asynchronous Subprocesses</h2>

<p>An asynchronous subprocess is one which runs in the background whilst your
program continues with other work.</p>

<p>Asynchronous subprocesses are created using the async_subprocess class. The
interface to this class is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class async_subprocess
{
public:
  async_subprocess(void);
  virtual ~async_subprocess(void);

  void add_variable(const std::string&amp; name, const std::string&amp; value);
  bool remove_variable(const std::string&amp; name);

  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; path, const arg_vector&amp; argv,
             bool connect_stdin = false, bool connect_stdout = false, bool connect_stderr = false);
  bool spawn(const std::string&amp; command_line,
             bool connect_stdin = false, bool connect_stdout = false, bool connect_stderr = false);

  virtual bool callback(void);
  bool tick(void);
  bool kill(void);

  int write_stdin(std::string&amp; buffer);
  int read_stdout(std::string&amp; buffer);
  int read_stderr(std::string&amp; buffer);

  void close_stdin(void);
  void close_stdout(void);
  void close_stderr(void);

  bool error(void) const;
  std::string error_text(void) const;

  int exit_status(void) const;
};
</pre>

<p>This is very similar to the synchronous subprocess and I will only explain
the differences.</p>

<p>The main difference is that the spawn functions return immediately after the
child starts. The return value of spawn is true if the child started and false if
it doesn't. However, the child is left running.</p>

<p>To test whether the child is still running, you need to call the tick
function periodically. The tick function normally returns true, but will return
false when the child has finished. If you don't care whether its still running
you can just leave it running in the background. The child will terminate when
it has finished or when the kill function is called or when the async_subprocess
class is destroyed. </p>

<p>Note that destroying the class terminates the child - this class implements
an asynchronous subprocess, not a detached process.</p>

<p>Each time the tick function is called, the callback() function is called. This
makes the callback() function different from the synchronous form in that it will be
called many times, not just once. The callback() function can do I/O. However, you
can also do I/O directly from outside the class using the provided read and
write functions, so there is no real need to provide a customised callback()
function. This facility has been provided for the rare cases where this way of
working is easier to implement.</p>

<p>As before, the callback() function can be used to control the child - it can
return false, in which case the tick() function will kill the child. the same can
be done from outside the class by calling the kill() function directly.</p>

<p>Note: always use the kill function in the class to terminate the child, which
has been ported to Unix and Windows, not the Unix kill function which is
non-portable to Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The read routines implement non-blocking I/O, but
the write to standard input only does so on Unix. So far I have not found a way
of doing non-blocking writes on Windows.</p>

<p>Note: if you know of such a method (which also works on 95/98), please tell
me about it.</p>

<p>This limitation has an affect on the way you use the functions - you should
only perform a write when you know that the standard input pipe has enough
buffer space to accept the write and that the other input/error pipes are not
blocked by text waiting to be read. In general you should read from those pipes
first, then write to the standard input. The final choice depends on what you
know about the command running in the subprocess.</p>

<p>When performing reads, the read functions will return immediately, they will
not block. The return value is -1 for an error or for end-of-file. These two
cases can be differentiated by whether there is an error(). It
will return 0 if there was no text to read and &gt;0 if text was read
successfully. Note that the buffer is appended with the specified number of
bytes, so the string will become longer with each successive read unless you
explicitly erase it between reads.</p>

<p>The non-blocking nature of the read operations allows you to read both
standard output and standard error by interleaving the calls to the read
functions.</p>

<p>The main trick when using asynchronous subprocesses is to not give up reading
the output too soon. Typically the child will finish before the output buffers
have been read by the parent. Therefore a good strategy is to read the output
until end of file is found, then keep calling tick() until the subprocess
exits. It is then poossible to test the exit status. Note that you must call
tick() until it returns false to ensure that the subprocess does exit properly
and the status can be caught. On Unix for example, not doing thius will leave
so-called "Zombie" processes behind.</p>

<p>Here's an example that does just this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
string input = ...;
string output;
for(;;)
{
  // the input string is consumed by the write, so will be zero length when all writing is finished
  if (input.size() == 0)
    async.close_stdin(); // this will be called many times - no problem
  else
    async.write_stdin(input); // could test for error - returns -1
  int read = async.read_stdout(output);
  // test for end of input
  if (read == -1)
  {
    // now wait for the subprocess to exit
    while(async.tick()) ;
    break;
  }
}
if (async.error()) ferr &lt;&lt; "error detected - " &lt;&lt; async.error_text() &lt;&lt; endl;
ferr &lt;&lt; "command exited with status " &lt;&lt; async.exit_status() &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>

<p>Of course, in practice, the only reason for using an asynchronous subprocess
is that you want to do other things whilst it is running, so those other
activities would be added to the main loop. Alternatively, a single read/write
combination could be done each time round an event loop in a GUI (or more likely
only on idle events).</p>
