TODO list for STLPlus
=====================

General
-------

Change assertions to exceptions where there is any possibility of user (i.e.
programmer as user of STLplus) error.

OS Fixes
--------

No documentation.

Ini Manager
-----------

Need to be able to modify any file loaded into the manager (could allow
read-only files though and it would be a good idea if file-system rights
controlled this too).

Each file would have an ID and that would become an argument to the
modification routines. Optional of course. Also, read a value from any file by
ID.

Dan would like to implement projects as multiple files all of the same
priority. The current idea of a search order could be changed to some kind of
tree or DAG ordering. Simpler would be a layering effect where each file has a
depth.

Change the add_values quoting mechanism to quoted strings by default rather
than escaped strings by default. Support both?

The documentation for ini_manager is too sparse - there is insufficient
description of the escaped strings and quoted strings formats.

Support for path values with localisation of the path to the Ini file on write
and conversion to full path on read.

Inf
---

Need slice operations.

Possibly an unsigned variant?

Library Manager
---------------

Handle read-only directories and index files.

Handle multiple libraries managing the same directory - needs an interlock
method to prevent concurrent writes and some method to indicate to a library
manager that the in-memory copy is out of date.
