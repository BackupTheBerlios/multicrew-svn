<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This header provides access to a set of operating-system independent file and
folder handling functions. This may not seem very important if you are
working on a Windows-only development or a Unix-only development, but the
functions also provide a clean and simple way of handling directories and files
which is far more usable than the conventional interface provided by the native
OS and includes solutions to known problems with the OS interfaces. It is
therefore a good idea to use these functions for all file-system access and
manipulation even where portability is not an issue.</p>

<p>The interface is a set of functions which manipulate file names, folder
names and full paths as strings. There are also functions for testing existence
of files and directories and simply testing access permissions.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>The following terminology is used both in the C++ interface and in the following descriptions.</p>

<dl>

<dt>filename</dt>

<dd>The name of a file excluding any folder information.</dd>

<dt>filespec (short for file-specification)</dt>

<dd>The name of a file optionally including folder information, which may be
in either relative or absolute form - this corresponds to the user-orientated
view of files.</dd>

<dt>folder</dt>

<dd>A container for files - in fact stored on most file systems (including Unix)
by a special kind of file and therefore shares many attributes with files. When
it comes to manipulating file systems it is best to keep the concept
separate.</dd>

<dt>directory</dt>

<dd>Synonym for folder. I have chosen to use folder throughout, just to be
awkward.<dd>

<dt>absolute path</dt>

<dd>Also known as a full path, this specifies a filespec or folder in its
fullest form i.e. relative to the root of the file system. On Unix absolute
paths start with a '/'. On Windows they start with a drive letter such as
C:.</dd>

<dt>relative path</dt>

<dd>Also known as a partial path, this specifies a filespec or folder
relative to the current working folder. The path can include the string ".."
to mean the folder above the current working folder.</dd>

<dt>basename</dt>

<dd>The filename minus any extension part. For example, the basename of
gobbledegook.doc is gobbledegook. To change the extension of a file, take its
basename, then add a new extension.</dd>

<dt>extension</dt>

<dd>The part of a filename after the '.'. The extension usually gives some clue
as to the type or purpose of the file. Related files often have the same
basename but different extensions. On Unix, the extension is
optional. Furthermore, if a filename starts with a '.' this is considered part
of the basename since this is the Unix convention for a hidden file.</dd>

<dt>path</dt>

<dd>A combined folder and filename. Describes the path you would trace
through the file system to get to the specified file. Also known as a
filespec.</dd>

</dl>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="classifying">Classifying Functions</h2>

<p>This small collection allows you to test for the existence of something and
to further classify it as a file or a folder.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool is_present (const string&amp; thing);
bool is_folder (const string&amp; thing);
bool is_file (const string&amp; thing);
</pre>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="files">File Functions</h2>

<p>This is a set of functions for manipulating files and filenames.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_exists (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Tests to see whether there is a file with the specified name on the file
system. Will return true if the object named does exist and is a file (rather
than a folder or other kind of object). Will return false if either the file
does not exist or if there is something with the given name but it is not a
file. </p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_readable (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Tests whether the file exists, and if it does whether it can be read.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_writable (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Tests whether the file can be written to. This is true either if the file
already exists and is writable or if the file does not exist but the folder
is writable.</p>

<pre class="cpp">size_t file_size (const string&amp; filespec);</pre>

<p>Gives the size of the file in bytes. Returns zero if the file does not
exist. This is not a good test for non-existence because you can also have
zero-sized files - so use file_exists in conjunction with file_size.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_delete (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Deletes the file. Returns true if the file existed and was deleted. Returns
false if the file did not exist or could not be deleted. Usually combined with
file_exists to determine the reason for failure. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (file_exists(file) &amp;&amp; !file_delete(file))
  // report error in deleting file
</pre>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_rename (const std::string&amp; old_filespec, const std::string&amp; new_filespec);</pre>

<p>Renames the file, returning true if the rename worked and false if it
failed. It will fail if either the old filespec doesn't exist, or if you have
insufficient access to move the old file or if you have insufficient access to
create the new file.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_copy(const std::string&amp; old_filespec, const std::string&amp; new_filespec);</pre>

<p>Copies the file, returning true if the copy succeeded and false if it
failed. It will fail if either the old filespec doesn't exist, or if you have
insufficient access to read the old file or if you have insufficient access to
create and write the new file.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool file_move(const std::string&amp; old_filespec, const std::string&amp; new_filespec);</pre>

<p>Moves the file. Tries a file_rename, but if that fails tries a file_copy
followed by file_delete of the old file. If the copy succeeds but the delete
fails, it deletes the new file to restore the original state. Returns true if
the old file has gone and the new one is there.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="access">File Access Mode Functions</h2>

<pre class="cpp">
// basic modes
extern const int read__mode;
extern const int write_mode;
extern const int execute_mode;
// combined modes
extern const int none_mode;
extern const int read_write_mode;
extern const int all_mode;
// basic users
extern const int owner_mask;
extern const int group_mask;
extern const int other_mask;
// combined users
extern const int non_owner_mask;
extern const int all_mask;
// common settings
extern const int read_mode_all;
extern const int read_write_mode_owner_read_mode_all;
extern const int read_mode_owner_only;
extern const int read_write_mode_owner_only;
// the function itself
bool file_set_mode (const string&amp; filespec, int mode)
</pre>

<p>The function file_set_mode() changes the access permissions on the file.
Returns true if the file exists and the mode was changed. Returns false if the
file did not exist or if the mode change failed.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to chmod() on Unix, but I've insulated the user from
the low-level routine because of differences in the OSs' interpretation of the
mode parameter.</p>

<p>This function is really only used for read-only versus read-write control.
I've defined a new set of constants to control this, to hide potentially
platform specific features. The idea is to combine the constants as bit-masks
so as to build up a set of permissions. The modes are ORed together to build
up a set of permissions and then ANDed with a mask to control which people
have that permission. Permissions can be ORed together too. So, for example,
to give the owner read-write access and all others only read access, you would
use the expression:</p>

<pre class="cpp">((read_mode | write_mode) & owner_mask) | (read_mode & (group_mask | other_mask))</pre>

<p>This can be simplified by using combined modes and combined masks to:</p>

<pre class="cpp">(read_write_mode & owner_mask) | (read_mode & non_owner_mask)</pre>

<p>Windows implements a subset of the Unix functionality, so when using this
function you need to think Unix and not Windows. That way, both versions will
work correctly. The most common arrangement is for the owner to have
read-write access and all others to have read-only access. This is captured by
the constant read_write_mode_owner_read_mode_all. Sorry for the length of the
name! Another common requirement is to lock out all other users but the owner
- this is captured by read_write_mode_owner_only. Other combinations that
occur occasionally is to make a file read-only either for everyone
(read_mode_all) or for just the owner (read_mode_owner_only).</p>

<p>On Windows, these simplify to either read-only mode or read-write mode.</p>

<p>Windows does have more subtle access control than this, but that
functionality is buried in the concept of access control lists, which are
deeply buried in the operating system, very difficult to use and abysmally
documented. Unless you are writing low-level system tools, there is no need to
go there. If you are writing low-level system tools, then they will be
platform-specific and so this package will be of no use to you anyway.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="timestamps">File Timestamp Functions</h2>

<pre class="cpp">
time_t file_created (const string&amp; filespec)
time_t file_modified (const string&amp; filespec)
time_t file_accessed (const string&amp; filespec)
</pre>

<p>Gets the various timestamps of the file using the time_t type defined in
the system header &lt;time.h&gt;. This is the same type returned by the time()
function. The return type is an integer type so can be used in
comparisons. Returns 0 if the file does not exist and it is safe to rely on this
feature.</p>

<p>The created time is the time when the file was created (obviously), the
modified time is the time last written to and the accessed time is the time
last read or written to.</p>

<p>See <a href="time.html">time.hpp</a> for some simple utilities for
manipulating the time_t type.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="filespec">File Specification Functions</h2>

<p><b>Note:</b> These used to be called filespec and filename but these short
forms tended to conflict a lot with variables, so I added the create_ prefix
to prevent this.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string create_filespec (const string&amp; folder, const string&amp; filename)</pre>

<p>Combines a folder (optional) with a filename (optional) to form a
filespec. This is done by simple string concatenation - no knowledge of the file
system is used - so it can be used to form a filespec for a folder or file that
doesn't exist yet. Main use is to automatically sort out the punctuation - for
example if the folder is not terminated by a '/', then this will be added. If
the folder is already terminated, then another '/' will not be added. Thus
the result is in a regular form. Furthermore it has been ported to Windows and
Unix.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string create_filespec (const string&amp; folder, const string&amp; basename, const string&amp; extension)</pre>

<p>Similar to above, but also handles the punctuation for an extension. The
(optional) folder is added to the (optional) filename and the (optional)
extension with the correct punctuation to make a correct filespec. Note that the
extension should not include the '.'.</p>

<pre class="cpp">std::string create_filename(const std::string&amp; basename, const std::string&amp; extension);</pre>

<p>Similar to above, but only generates a filename part (no folder part) from
a basename and an extension, correctly handling the punctuation for an extension.</p>

<p>These three functions are just string manipulations so don't appear to be
very useful. However, they do handle the punctuation of filespecs for you and
in an operating-system independent way (for example, on Windows, the folder
separator is '\' instead of '/'). They avoid a lot of fiddly string
handling.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="folders">Folder Functions</h2>

<p>This is a set of functions for manipulating folders and folder names.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_create (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Creates a new folder. Returns true if the creation succeeded. Returns
false if the folder failed, either because it already exists or there are
insufficient access privileges to create it.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_exists (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Tests whether an object of the given name (which can be a path) exists and is
a folder rather than any other kind of object. Returns true if this is the
case. Returns false if either the object does not exist or is not a
folder. </p>

<p>To test whether an object of a certain name exists as either a folder or a
file, you must use both file_exists and folder_exists tests, since file_exists
returns false if an object exists as a folder and folder_exists returns false if
the object exists as a file.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_readable (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Tests whether it is possible to have read-only access to the contents of a
folder. Returns true if the folder exists and has read access
available. Returns false if the folder does not exist or does not have the
right privileges for read-only access.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_writable (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Tests whether it is possible to create files in the given folder. Returns
true if the folder exists and has write access available. Returns false if
the folder either does not exist or does not have the right privileges for
write access.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_delete (const string&amp; folder, bool recurse = false)</pre>

<p>Deletes the folder. If the recurse option is set, deletes the contents of
the folder first. Returns true if the deletion succeeds. Returns false if it
fails, either because the folder did not exist or it contained something and
recurse was not set (you can only delete an empty folder if recurse is false)
or recurse was set but it was not possible to delete something within the
folder. The most common cause of failure of a recursive delete is
insufficient access rights to delete something in the folder, which
subsequently causes the folder delete to fail. In this case some but not all
of the folder contents will have been deleted.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_rename (const std::string&amp; old_directory, const std::string&amp; new_directory);</pre>

<p>Renames the folder, returning true if the rename worked and false if it
failed. It will fail if either the old folder doesn't exist, or if you have
insufficient access to move the old folder or if you have insufficient access to
create the new folder.</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_empty(const std::string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>Tests whether the folder has no files in it!</p>

<pre class="cpp">bool folder_set_current(const std::string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>Changes the current folder for the running application. Returns true if the
change succeeded (folder exists) and false if it failed.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_current (void)</pre>

<p>The name of the current folder. This returns the shorthand relative path
".". It is a trivial function but nevertheless should be used to hide this
shorthand, thus giving more portable code (this shorthand does not necessarily
apply to other operating systems).</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_home (void)</pre>

<p>The name of the user's home folder. On Unix this is obtained from the
environment variable HOME. On Windows it is obtained from environment variables
HOME_DRIVE and HOME_PATH.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_down (const string&amp; folder, const string&amp; subfolder)</pre>

<p>Performs the string handling and the necessary punctuation handling to add a
subfolder name to a folder path (relative or absolute) to give the path of
the subfolder. For example, the folder "garbage/rubbish" combined with the
subfolder "todays" gives the path "garbage/rubbish/todays". The main benefit
is that the handling of the punctuation is hidden and will adjust, for example
if the folder is already terminated with a '/'. It is also ported to Unix and
Windows and uses the appropriate punctuation for the operating system.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_up (const string&amp; folder, unsigned levels=1)</pre>

<p>Performs the string handling and punctuation handling necessary to specify
the parent of folder by adding the conventional shorthand ".." to the
folder. This hides the conventional shorthand, again for portability and
simplicity.</p>

<p>The levels argument specifies the number of directory levels to go up. The
default is 1.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="folder_contents">Folder Contents Functions</h2>

<pre class="cpp">vector&lt;string&gt; folder_subdirectories (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Extracts an array of subfolder names (not paths) of all the subdirectories
found in the specified folder. Each of these names can be combined with the
folder by folder_down() to give the path to each subfolder.</p>

<pre class="cpp">vector&lt;string&gt; folder_files (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>Extracts an array of filenames (not paths) of all the files found in the
specified folder. Each of these names can be combined with folder and
form_filespec() to give the filespec of each file.</p>

<pre class="cpp">vector&lt;string&gt; folder_wildcard (const string&amp; folder, const string&amp; wildcard, bool subfolders = true, bool files = true);</pre>

<p>Extracts an array of subfolder and file names matching the wildcard
expression. For example, to get the set of header files in a folder, use the
expression "*.h". Note that this is a wildcard, like that used in command
shells, not a regular expression. The names are simple strings, not full paths,
but can be converted into full paths by using form_filespec. The two switches
allow filtering of subfolders or files, so for example only files matching the
wildcard can be selected by setting the subfolders flag to false and the files
flag to true.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="paths">Path Functions</h2>

<p>This set of functions is used for converting folder names or filespecs to
full paths or back to relative paths. They also implement simplification
(removal of redundant "." and ".." parts).</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool is_full_path(const std::string&amp; path);
bool is_relative_path(const std::string&amp; path);
</pre>

<p>Tests for whether a particular string represents a full or partial path.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_to_path(const string&amp; root, const string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>Takes a folder name, which may itself be a relative or even a full path, and
converts it to a full path. If it is a relative path, then root specifies the
starting point of that relative path. If it is already a full path, then root is
irrelevant. Finally, the path is simplified by removal
of "." and ".." parts, to give a full path.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_to_path (const string&amp; folder)</pre>

<p>As above, but the root is assumed to be the current working directory.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string filespec_to_path(const string&amp; root, const string&amp; filespec);</pre>

<p>Similar to folder_to_path, but assumes the last part of the path being processed
is a filename, not a folder. This is therefore not considered as a candidate
for path simplification.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string filespec_to_path (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>As above, but the root is assumed to be the current working directory as
given by folder_current().</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_to_relative_path(const string&amp; root, const string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>The complementary function to folder_to_path, this takes a path and if that
path is a full path, it converts it to a relative path. The root folder
specifies where the starting point for that relative path should be.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_to_relative_path(const string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>As above, but the root is assumed to be the current working directory.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string filespec_to_relative_path(const string&amp; root, const string&amp; filespec);</pre>

<p>Similar to folder_to_relative_path, but assumes the last part of the path being processed
is a filename, not a folder. This is therefore not considered as a candidate
for path simplification.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string filespec_to_relative_path(const string&amp; filespec);</pre>

<p>As above, but the root is assumed to be the current working directory.</p>

<pre class="cpp">std::string folder_append_separator(const std::string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>makes sure the path ends in a separator to make absolutely clear to any
other code that this reaslly represents a folder and not a file. For example,
"fred/has/germs" could refer to a file or a folder called germs, but
"fred/has/germs/" unambiguously represents a folder.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="dissection">Dissection Functions</h2>

<p>This set of functions allows a filespec to be dissected into its constituent
parts, specifically the folder part or the filename part. Furthermore the
filename part can be further divided into its basename and its extension.</p>

<p>These functions perform string manipulation only and rely on correct
punctuation to give correct results. No knowledge of the file system is
used.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string basename_part (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Extracts the filename part and then removes the extension to leave the
basename. The extension is removed by finding the last '.' in the filename and
discarding everything after that. Thus the basename of 'test/test1.vhdl' is
'test1'. Furthermore, a '.' at the start of the filename is ignored since this is
the Unix convention for a hidden file and therefore does not designate an
extension (Note: this convention is also used on Windows - sometimes). Thus the
basename part of the filename '.emacs' is '.emacs'.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string extension_part (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Complements the above. This is the string that is discarded in forming the
basename, with the '.' removed too (when handling extensions, the '.' is always
excluded since it is considered part of the punctuation, not part of the name
itself). Thus the extenion part of 'test/test1.vhdl' is 'vhdl'.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string filename_part (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Extracts the end of the filespec back to the first '/' (either '/' or '\' on
Windows) and returns the extracted string. May be empty if the filespec ends in
'/'. May be the whole filespec if it has no '/'. Thus, the filename part of
'test/test1.vhdl' is 'test1.vhdl'.</p>

<pre class="cpp">string folder_part (const string&amp; filespec)</pre>

<p>Removes the end of the filespec back to the first '/' (either '/' or '\' on
Windows), thus leaving the folder part of the filespec. This may be empty if
there is no folder part. It may make no change if the filespec had no
filename part (i.e. is terminated by a '/'). Thus the folder part of
'test/test1.vhdl' is 'test'.</p>

<pre class="cpp">std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; folder_elements(const std::string&amp; folder);</pre>

<p>Splits the folder path into its string elements by removing the folder
separator character (e.g. '/' on Unix) and creates a vector containing the
remaining string fragments.</p>

<pre class="cpp">std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; filespec_elements(const std::string&amp; filespec);</pre>

<p>As above but for a filespec, so the last element will be the filename part.</p>

</div>

<div id="documentSection">

<h2 id="lookup">Lookup Functions</h2>

<p>When you type a command into a shell (whether DOS command prompt, C-shell,
Bourne-shell or Porn-shell), the command is searched for using the values of the
PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This PATH lookup is reproduced by the function path_lookup():</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string path_lookup (const std::string&amp; command);
</pre>

<p>Give this function the name of a command and it will return the full
path. Furthermore, the function uses the correct operating-system dependent way
of specifying paths. On Unix, paths are separated by the ':' character, whereas
on DOS the ';' character is used.</p>

<p>To give more detail, there are some special cases to be handled. the actual
behaviour is:</p>

<ul>

<li>If the command is already a path, simply return the same string, since PATH
lookup is never carried out on full paths. However, under Windoze, the .exe
extension will be added. The existence of the command is not
checked if it is a full path.</li>

<li>If the command is a simple name, search through the directories listed by
PATH until the command is found and return the path constructed from that
directory and the command name. On Windows, commands without an extension will
also be searched for with the extension .exe.</li>

<li>If the command cannot be found, return the empty string. </li>

</ul>

<p>This means that you should test the result to see if it is empty (using the
string empty() member function) and only create the subprocess if the command
was found.</p>

<p>There is no need to test whether the command is already a path since the
function does that for you.</p>

<pre class="cpp">std::string lookup (const std::string&amp; file, const std::string&amp; path, const std::string&amp; splitter = PATH_SPLITTER);</pre>

<p>This is a generalised form of the above, which takes a second argument -
the list to search. This can be used to do other path lookups, such as
searching for a library in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The third argument specifies the
splitter used to separate values in the list - the default value of
PATH_SPLITTER is appropriate for environment variables. Returns an empty
string on failure.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string result = lookup("libgtk.a", getenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH"));
</pre>

<p>The final function in this set is the install_path function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string install_path(const std::string&amp; argv0);
</pre>

<p>This takes as its argument the argv[0] parameter passed to the main
function by the operating system. It uses this parameter plus the PATH variable to work
out which folder the current program was in, i.e. the location of the executable. This can be used to find data
files associated with a program. For example, you may have a system
distribution that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;root&gt;
<ul>
<li>bin
<ul>
<li>&lt;programs&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>config
<ul>
<li>&lt;data files&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When you run one of the programs, the install_path function will return the
path to the bin folder. The config folder can then be found by going up a
level and then down:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  string install_folder = install_path(argv[0])
  string config_folder = folder_down(folder_up(install_folder),"config");
  ...
